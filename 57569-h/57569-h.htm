<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Hints on Child-Training may be helpful, where
a formal treatise on the subject would prove bewildering.
It is easier to see how one phase or
another of children’s needs is to be met, than it
is to define the relation of that phase of the case to
all other phases, or to a system that includes them
all. Therefore it is that this series of Hints is
ventured by me for the benefit of young parents,
although I would not dare attempt a systematic
treatise on the entire subject here touched upon.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, when I was yet a young father,
a friend, who knew that I had for years been interested
in the study of methods of education, said
to me, “Trumbull, what is your theory of child-training?”
“Theory?” I responded. “I have no
theory in that matter. I had lots of theories before
I had any children; but now I do, with fear and
trembling, in every case just that which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
be the better thing for the hour, whether it agrees
with any of my old theories or not.”</p>

<p>Whatever theory of child-training may show
itself in these Hints, has been arrived at by induction
in the process of my experiences with children
since I had to deal with the matter practically,
apart from any preconceived view of the principles
involved. Every suggestion in these Hints is an
outcome of experiment and observation in my life
as a father and a grandfather, while it has been
carefully considered in the light of the best lessons
of practical educators on every side.</p>

<p>These Hints were begun for the purpose of giving
help to a friend. They were continued because
of the evident popular interest in them. They are
sent out in this completed form in the hope that
they will prove of service to parents who are feeling
the need of something more practical in the
realm of child-training than untested theories.</p>

<i>CHILD-TRAINING: WHAT IS IT?</i></h2></div>


<p>The term “training,” like the term “teaching,”
is used in various senses; hence it is liable to be
differently understood by different persons, when
applied to a single department of a parent’s duties
in the bringing up of his children. Indeed, the
terms “training” and “teaching” are often used
interchangeably, as covering the entire process of
a child’s education. In this sense a child’s training
is understood to include his teaching; and,
again, his teaching is understood to include his
training. But in its more restricted sense the
training of a child is the shaping, the developing,
and the controlling of his personal faculties and
powers; while the teaching of a child is the securing
to him of knowledge from beyond himself.</p>

<p>It has been said that the essence of teaching is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
causing another to <i>know</i>. It may similarly be said
that the essence of training is causing another to
<i>do</i>. Teaching gives knowledge. Training gives
skill. Teaching fills the mind. Training shapes
the habits. Teaching brings to the child that
which he did not have before. Training enables
a child to make use of that which is already his
possession. We teach a child the meaning of
words. We train a child in speaking and walking.
We teach him the truths which we have
learned for ourselves. We train him in habits of
study, that he may be able to learn other truths
for himself. Training and teaching must go on
together in the wise upbringing of any and every
child. The one will fail of its own best end if it
be not accompanied by the other. He who knows
how to teach a child, is not competent for the oversight
of a child’s education unless he also knows
how to train a child.</p>

<p>Training is a possibility long before teaching is.
Before a child is old enough to know what is said
to it, it is capable of feeling, and of conforming to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or of resisting, the pressure of efforts for its training.
A child can be trained to go to sleep in the
arms of its mother or nurse, or in a cradle, or on a
bed; with rocking, or without it; in a light room,
or in a dark one; in a noisy room, or only in a
quiet one; to expect nourishment and to accept it
only at fixed hours, or at its own fancy,—while as
yet it cannot understand any teaching concerning
the importance or the fitness of one of these things.
A very young child can be trained to cry for what
it wants, or to keep quiet, as a means of securing
it. And, as a matter of fact, the training of children
is begun much earlier than their teaching.
Many a child is well started in its life-training by
the time it is six weeks old; even though its elementary
teaching is not attempted until months
after that.</p>

<p>There is a lesson just at this point in the signification
of the Hebrew word translated “train” in
our English Bible. It is a noteworthy fact, that
this word occurs only twice in the Old Testament,
and it has no equivalent in the New. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
were brought up in the household of Abraham,
“the father of the faithful,” are said to have been
“trained” (Gen. 14: 14). A proverb of the ages
gives emphasis to a parent’s duty to “train up”
his child with wise considerateness (Prov. 22: 6).
And nowhere else in the inspired record does the
original of this word “train,” in any of its forms,
appear.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word thus translated is a peculiar
one. Its etymology shows that its primary meaning
is “to rub the gullet;” and its origin seems to
have been in the habit, still prevalent among primitive
peoples, of opening the throat of a new-born
babe by the anointing of it with blood, or with
saliva, or with some sacred liquid, as a means of
giving the child a start in life by the help of
another’s life. The idea of the Hebrew word thus
used seems to be that, as this opening of the gullet
of a child at its very birth is essential to the habituating
of the child to breathe and to swallow correctly,
so the right training of a child in all proper
habits of life is to begin at the child’s very birth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
And the use of the word in the places where we
find it, would go to show that Abraham with all
his faith, and Solomon with all his wisdom, did not
feel that it would be safe to put off the start with a
child’s training any later than this.</p>

<p>Child-training properly begins at a child’s birth,
but it does not properly end there. The first effort
in the direction of child-training is to train a child
to breathe and to swallow; but that ought not to
be the last effort in the same direction. Child-training
goes on as long as a child is a child; and
child-training covers every phase of a child’s action
and bearing in life. Child-training affects a child’s
sleeping and waking, his laughing and crying, his
eating and drinking, his looks and his movements,
his self-control and his conduct toward others.
Child-training does not change a child’s nature,
but it does change his modes of giving expression
to his nature. Child-training does not give a child
entirely new characteristics, but it brings him to
the repression and subdual of certain characteristics,
and to the expression and development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
certain others, to such an extent that the sum of
his characteristics presents an aspect so different
from its original exhibit that it seems like another
character. And so it is that child-training is, in
a sense, like the very making of a child anew.</p>

<p>Child-training includes the directing and controlling
and shaping of a child’s feelings and
thoughts and words and ways in every sphere of
his life-course, from his birth to the close of his
childhood. And that this is no unimportant part
of a child’s upbringing, no intelligent mind will
venture to question.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>II.<br /><br />

<i>THE DUTY OF TRAINING
CHILDREN.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It is the mistake of many parents to suppose
that their chief duty is in loving and counseling
their children, rather than in loving and training
them; that they are faithfully to show their children
what they ought to do, rather than to make
them do it. The training power of the parent is,
as a rule, sadly undervalued.</p>

<p>Too many parents seem to take it for granted
that because their children are by nature very
timid and retiring, or very bold and forward; very
extravagant in speech and manner, or quite disinclined
to express even a dutiful sense of gratitude
and trust; reckless in their generosity, or pitiably
selfish; disposed to overstudy, or given wholly to
play; one-sided in this, or in that, or in the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
trait or quality or characteristic,—therefore those
children must remain so; unless, indeed, they outgrow
their faults, or are induced by wise counsel
and loving entreaty to overcome them.</p>

<p>“My boy is irrepressible,” says one father. “He
is full of dash and spirits. He makes havoc in the
house while at home; and when he goes out to a
neighbor’s he either has things his own way, or he
doesn’t want to go <i>there</i> again. I really wish he
had a quieter nature; but, of course, I can’t change
him. I have given him a great many talks about
this; and I hope he will outgrow the worst of it.
Still he is just what he is, and punishing him
wouldn’t make him anybody else.” A good
mother, on the other hand, is exercised because
her little son is so bashful that he is always mortifying
her before strangers. He will put his finger
in his mouth, and hang down his head, and twist
one foot over the other, and refuse to shake hands,
or to answer the visitor’s “How do you do, my
boy?” or even to say, “I thank you,” with distinctness,
when anything is given to him. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
same trouble is found with the tastes as with the
temperaments of children. One is always ready
to hear stories read or told, but will not sit quiet
and look at pictures, or use a slate and pencil.
Another, a little older, will devour books of travel
or adventure, but has no patience with a simple
story of home life, or a book of instruction in
matters of practical fact.</p>

<p>Now it is quite inevitable that children should
have these peculiarities; but it is not inevitable that
they should continue to exhibit them offensively.
Children can be trained in almost any direction.
Their natural tendencies may be so curbed and
guided as no longer to show themselves in disagreeable
prominence. It is a parent’s privilege, and it
is a parent’s duty, to make his children, by God’s
blessing, to be and to do what they should be and
do, rather than what they would like to be and do.
If indeed this were not so, a parent’s mission would
be sadly limited in scope, and diminished in importance
and preciousness. The parent who does not
recognize the possibility of training his children as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
well as instructing them, misses one of his highest
privileges as a parent, and fails of his most important
work for his children.</p>

<p>The skilled physician in charge of a certain
institution for the treatment of feeble-minded and
imperfectly developed children, has said, that some
children who are brought to him are lacking in
just one important trait or quality, while they possess
a fair measure of every other. Or it may be
said, that they have an excess of the trait or quality
opposite to that which they lack.</p>

<p>One girl, for example, will be wholly without a
sense of honesty; will even be possessed with a
love of stealing for stealing’s sake, carrying it to
such an extent that when seated at the table she
will snatch a ball of butter from a plate, and wrap
it up in a fold of her dress. If she should be
unchecked in this propensity until she were a grown
woman, she might prove one of the fashionable
ladies who take books or dry goods from the stores
where they are shopping, under the influence of
“kleptomania.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, a boy has no sense of truth. He will tell
lies without any apparent temptation to do so, even
against his own obvious interests. All of us have
seen persons of this sort in mature life. Some of
them are to-day in places of prominence in Christian
work and influence. Yet another child is
without any sense of reverence, or of modesty, or
of natural affection. One lacks all control of his
temper, another of his nerves. And so on in great
variety.</p>

<p>The physician of that institution is by no means
in despair over any of these cases. It is his
mission to find out the child’s special lack, and
to meet it; to learn what traits are in excess, and
to curb them; to know the child’s needs, and to
<i>train</i> him accordingly.</p>

<p>Every child is in a sense a partially developed,
an imperfectly formed child. There are no absolutely
perfect children in this world. All of them
need restraining in some things and stimulating in
others. And every imperfect child can be helped
toward a symmetrical character by wise Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
training. Every home should be an institution for
the treatment of imperfectly developed children.
Every father and every mother should be a skilled
physician in charge of such an institution. There
are glorious possibilities in this direction; and there
are weighty responsibilities also.</p>

<i>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF
CHILD-TRAINING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Child-training can compass much, but child-training
cannot compass everything, in determining
the powers and the possibilities of a child under
training. Each child can be trained in the way <i>he</i>
should go, but not every child can be trained to go
in the same way. Each child can be trained to the
highest and fullest exercise of <i>his</i> powers, but no
child can be trained to the exercise of powers
which are not his. Each child can be trained to
<i>his</i> utmost possibilities, but not every child can be
trained to the utmost possibilities of every other
child. Child-training has the fullest scope of the
capacity of the particular child under treatment,
and child-training is limited in every case by the
limitations of that child’s capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>A child born blind can be trained to such a use
of his other senses that he can do more in the
world than many a poorly trained child who has
sight; but a blind child can never be trained to
discern differences in colors at a distance. A child
who has by nature a dull ear for music can be
trained to more or less of musical skill; but a
child who is born without the sense of hearing can
never be trained to quickness in the discerning of
sounds. A child can be trained to facility in the
use of every sense and faculty and limb and member
and muscle and nerve which he possesses; but
no training will give to a child a new sense, a new
faculty, a new limb, a new member, a new muscle,
a new nerve. Child-training can make anything of
a child that can be made of that child, but child-training
cannot change a child’s nature and identity.</p>

<p>The limitations of child-training are more likely
to be realized than its extensive scope. Indeed,
the supposed limitations of child-training are very
often unreal ones. Many a parent would say, for
example, that you cannot change a child’s form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and features and expression by training; yet, as a
matter of fact, a child’s form and features and
expression can be, and often are, materially changed
by training. The chest is expanded, the waist is
compressed, a curved spine is straightened, or a
deformity of limb is corrected, by persistent training
with the help of mechanical appliances. Among
some primitive peoples, the form of every child’s
head is brought to a conventional standard by a
process of training; as, among other primitive peoples,
the feet or the ears or the eyes or the lips are
thus conventionally trained into—or out of—shape.
And in all lands the expression of the face steadily
changes under the process of persistent training.</p>

<p>As it is with the physical form, so it is with the
mental and moral characteristics of a child; the
range is wide within the limitations of possible
results from the training process. A nervous temperament
cannot, it is true, be trained into a phlegmatic
one, or a phlegmatic temperament be trained
into a nervous one; but a child who is quick and
impulsive can be trained into moderation and care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>fulness
of speech and of action, while a child who
is sluggish and inactive can be trained to rapidity
of movement and to energy of endeavor. An
imbecile mind can never be trained into the possibilities
of native genius, nor can a moral nature of
the lowest order be trained to the same measure of
high conscientiousness as a nature that is keenly
sensitive to every call of duty and to the rights and
the feelings of others; but training can give unsuspected
power to the dormant faculties of the dull-minded,
and can marvelously develop the latent
moral sense of any child who is capable of discerning
between right and wrong in conduct.</p>

<p>The sure limitations of a child’s possibilities of
training are obvious to a parent. If one of the
physical senses be lacking to the child, no training
will restore that sense, although wise training may
enable the child to overcome many of the difficulties
that meet him as a consequence of his native
lack. And so, also, if the child have such unmistakable
defects of mind and of character as prove
him to be inferior to the ordinary grade of average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
humanity, the wisest training cannot be expected
to lift him above the ordinary level of average
humanity. But if a child be in the possession of
the normal physical senses, and the normal mental
faculties, and the normal moral capacities, of his
race, he may, by God’s blessing, be trained to the
best and fullest use of his powers in these several
spheres, in spite of all the hindrances and drawbacks
that are found in the perversion or the imperfect
development of those powers at his start in life.</p>

<p>In other words, if the child be grievously
deformed or defective at birth, or by some early
casualty, there is an inevitable limitation accordingly
to the possibilities of his training. But if a
child be in possession of an ordinary measure of
faculties and capacity, his training will decide the
manner and method and extent of the use of his
God-given powers.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, largely a child’s training that settles
the question whether a child is graceful or awkward
in his personal movements, gentle or rough
in his ways with his fellows, considerate or thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>less
in his bearing toward others; whether he is
captious or tractable within the bounds of due
restraint; whether he is methodical and precise, or
unsystematic and irregular, in the discharge of his
daily duties; whether he is faithful in his studies,
or is neglectful of them; whether he is industrious
or indolent in his habits; whether the tastes which
he indulges in his diet and dress and reading and
amusements and companionships are refined, or are
low. In all these things his course indicates what
his training has been; or it suggests the training
that he needed, but has missed.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>IV.<br /><br />

<i>DISCERNING A CHILD’S SPECIAL NEED
OF TRAINING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Some one has said, that a mother is quite right
when she declares enthusiastically of her little one,
“There never was such a child as this, in the world,
before!” for in fact there never before was such a
child. Each child starts in life as if he were the
only child in the world, and the first one; and he
is less like other people then than ever he will be
again. He is conformed to no regulation pattern
at the outset. He has, to begin with, no stock of
ideas which have been passed on and approved by
others. He neither knows nor cares what other
people think. He is a law unto himself in all matters
of thought and taste and feeling. He is, so
far, himself; and, just so far, he is different from
everybody else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Left to himself, if that were a possibility, every
child would continue to be himself; but no child is
left to himself: he is under training and in training
continually. And so it is that the training of a
child is quite as likely to change him from his best
self to a poorer self, as it is to develop and perfect
that which is best in his distinctive self. Child-training
is, in many a case, the bringing of a child
into purely conventional ways, instead of bringing
out into freest play, in the child, those qualities and
characteristics which mark him as a unique and individual
personality among the sons of men. How
to learn wherein a child’s real self needs stimulating,
and wherein it needs curbing or changing, is a
question of questions in child-training.</p>

<p>No quality of a good physician is of more importance
than skill in making a diagnosis of a patient’s
case. If a master-mind in this realm were to pass
with positiveness on the disease of every patient, the
treatment of that disease would be comparatively
easy. A young graduate from the medical school,
or a trained nurse, would then, in most instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
be capable of knowing and doing that which was
needful in the premises. But until the diagnosis is
accurate, the best efforts of the ablest physician are
liable to be misdirected, and so to be ineffective for
good. As it is with the physician and his patient,
so it is with the parent and his child. An accurate
diagnosis is an essential prerequisite to wise and
efficient treatment. The diagnosis secured, the
matter of treatment is a comparatively easy matter.
A parent’s diagnosis of his child’s case is in the
discerning of his child’s faults, as preliminary to
a process of training for their cure. Until <i>that</i> is
secured, there is no hope of intelligent and well-directed
treatment.</p>

<p>Yet it is not the easiest thing in the world to say
what are a child’s peculiar faults, and what is, therefore,
that child’s peculiar need of training. Many
a parent is disturbed by a child’s best traits, while
he underestimates or overlooks that child’s chief
failings. And many another parent who knows
that his child is full of faults cannot say just what
they are, or classify them according to their rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>tive
prominence and their power for evil. “That
boy’s questions will worry my life out. He is
always asking questions; and <i>such</i> questions. I
can’t stand it!” This is said by many a father
or mother whose child is full of promise, largely
because he is full of questions.</p>

<p>But if a boy has a bright mind and positive preferences,
and is ready to study or to work untiringly
in the line of his own tastes, and in no other
line, it does not always occur to his parents that
just here—in this reluctance to apply himself in
the line of wise expediency rather than of personal
fancy—there is a failing which, if not trained out
of that boy, will stand as a barrier to his truest
manhood, and will make him a second-rate man
when he might be a first-rate one; a one-sided
man instead of a well-proportioned man. Such a
boy is quite likely to be looked upon as one who
must be permitted to have his own way, since that
way is evidently not a bad way, and he shows
unusual power in its direction. So that boy may
be left untrained in this particular until he is hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>lessly
past training, merely because his chief fault
is unrecognized by those who could correct it, and
who would gladly do so if they saw it in its due
proportions.</p>

<p>Careful study and a wise discrimination are
needed on a parent’s part to ascertain a child’s
peculiar faults. Each parent would do well to ask
himself, or herself, the questions, “What are the
special faults of my child? Where is he weakest?
In what direction is his greatest strength liable to
lead him astray, and when is it most likely to fail
him? Which of his faults is most prominent?
Which of them is of chief importance for immediate
correction?” Such questions as these should
be considered at a time favorable to deliberate
judgment, when there is least temptation to be
influenced by personal feeling, either of preference
or dissatisfaction. They should be pondered long
and well.</p>

<p>The unfriendly criticisms of neighbors, and the
kind suggestions of friends, are not to be despised
by a parent in making up an estimate of his child’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
failings and faults. Rarely is a parent so discerning,
so impartial, and so wise, that he can know
his children through and through, and be able to
weigh the several traits, and perceive the every
imperfection and exaggeration, of their characters,
with unerring accuracy and absolute fairness. A
judge is supposed to be disqualified for an impartial
hearing of a case in which he has a direct personal
interest. A physician will not commonly make a
diagnosis of his own disorders, lest his fears or hopes
should bias his judgment. And a parent is as liable
as a judge or a physician to be swayed unduly by
interest or affection, in an estimate of a case which
is before him for a decision.</p>

<p>Even though, therefore, every parent must decide
for himself concerning the interests and the
treatment of his own children, he ought to be
glad to take into consideration what others think
and say of those children, while he is making up
his mind as to his duty in the premises. And
what is written or said on this subject by competent
educators is worthy of attention from every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
parent who would train his children understandingly.
There is little danger that any parent will
give too much study to the question of his child’s
specific needs, or have too many helps to a wise
conclusion on that point. There is a great deal of
danger that the whole subject will be neglected or
undervalued by a parent.</p>

<p>If a parent were explicitly to ask the question of
a fair and plain-speaking friend, familiar with that
parent’s children, and competent to judge them,
What do you think is the chief fault—or the
most objectionable characteristic—of my son—or
daughter? the frank answer to that question would
in very many cases be an utter surprise to the
parent, the fault or characteristic named not having
been suspected by the parent. A child may
be so much like the parent just here, that the
parent’s blindness to his or her own chief fault or
lack may forbid the seeing of the child’s similar
deformity. Or, again, that child may be so totally
unlike the parent, that the parent will be unable to
appreciate, or even to apprehend, that peculiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the child which is apparent to every outside
intelligent observer. A child’s reticence from deep
feeling has often been counted by an over-demonstrative
parent as a sign of want of sensitiveness;
and so <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Parents need help from others, from personal
friends whom they can trust to speak with impartiality
and kindness, or from the teachers of their
children, in the gaining of a proper estimate and
understanding of their children’s characteristics
and needs. The parent who does not realize this
truth, and act on it, will never do as well as might
be done for his or her child. God has given
the responsibility of the training of that child to
the parent; but he has also laid on that parent the
duty of learning, by the aid of all proper means,
what are that child’s requirements, and how to
meet them.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>V.<br /><br />

<i>WILL-TRAINING, RATHER THAN
WILL-BREAKING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The measure of will-power is the measure of
personal power, with a child as with an adult. The
possession or the lack of will-power is the possession
or the lack of personal power, in every individual’s
sphere of life and being. The right or the
wrong use of will-power is the right or the wrong
exercise of an individual’s truest personality.
Hence the careful guarding and the wise guiding
of a child’s will should be counted among the foremost
duties of one who is responsible for a child’s
training.</p>

<p>Will-training is an important element in child-training;
but will-breaking has no part or place in
the training of a child. A broken will is worth as
much in its sphere as a broken bow; just that, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
no more. A child with a broken will is not so well
furnished for the struggle of life as a child with
only one arm, or one leg, or one eye. Such a
child has no power of strong personality, or of
high achievement in the world. Every child ought
to be trained to conform his will to the demands of
duty; but that is bending his will, not breaking it.
Breaking a child’s will is never in order.</p>

<p>The term “will” as here employed applies to
the child’s faculty of choosing or deciding between
two courses of action. Breaking a child’s will is
bringing the pressure of external force directly
upon that will, and causing the will to give way
under the pressure of that force. Training a child’s
will is bringing such influences to bear upon the
child that he is ready to choose or decide in favor
of the right course of action.</p>

<p>To break a child’s will is to crush out for the
time being, and so far to destroy, the child’s privilege
of free choice; it is to force him to an action
against his choice, instead of inducing him to
choose in the right direction. A child’s will is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
truest personality; the expression of his will in a
free choice is the highest expression of his personality.
And a child’s personality is to be held sacred
by God’s representative who is over the child, even
as God himself holds sacred the personality of
every human being created in the image of God.</p>

<p>God never says unqualifiedly to a human being,
“You shall not exercise your faculty of choice
between the way of life and the way of death; you
shall walk in the way which I know to be best for
you.” But, on the contrary, God says to every one
(Deut. 30: 15): “See, I have set before thee this
day life and good, and death and evil,”—for thy
choice. Here, as everywhere, God concedes to
man the privilege of exercising his will-power in
the direction of life and good, or of death and evil.
The strictest Calvinist and the broadest Arminian
are at one in their opinion so far. Whatever
emphasis is laid, in their philosophy, on God’s
influencing or enabling the human will to its final
choice, neither of them disputes the fact that man
is actually permitted to use that will in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of his choice. “It is God that worketh <i>in</i> man to
<i>will</i> and to work for His good pleasure.” It is not
that God worketh above man to crush out man’s
faculty of willing whether to act for or against His
good pleasure. In other words, God has fore-ordained
that every man shall have the freedom of
his will—and take the consequences.</p>

<p>It is true that God holds out before man, as an
inducement to him in his choosing, the inevitable
results of his choice. If he chooses good, life
comes with it. If he chooses evil, death is its
accompaniment. The rewards and the punishments
are declared in advance; but after all, and
in spite of all, the choice is man’s own. And every
soul shall have eternally the destiny of its own
choosing. The representative of God clothed with
power, as he stood before the people of Israel, did
not say, “You <i>shall</i> choose God’s service now;
and if you deliberately refuse to do so, God will
break your will so that you do do it;” but he said,
“If it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose
you this day whom ye will serve” (Josh. 24: 15).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>As God, our wise and loving Father in heaven,
deals with us his children, so we, as earthly fathers,
should deal with our children. We should guard
sacredly their privilege of personal choice; and
while using every proper means to induce them to
choose aright, we should never, never, never force
their choice, even into the direction of our intelligent
preference for them. The final responsibility
of a choice and of its consequences rests with the
child, and not with the parent.</p>

<p>A child’s will ought to be strong for right-doing.
If it be not so at the start, it is the parent’s duty to
guide, or train, it accordingly. But to break, or
crush, a child’s will, is inconsistent with the educating
and training of that will. A conflict between
a parent and a child, where the only
question is, Whose will shall yield to the other?
is, after all, neither more nor less than a conflict
of brute force.</p>

<p>Whether, in any instance, the will of the parent
be set on having his child commit some repulsive
crime against which the child’s moral nature recoils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
or whether the will of the parent be set on the
child’s reciting a Bible text or saying a prayer, the
mere conflict of wills as a conflict of wills is a conflict
of brute force; and in such a conflict neither
party ought to succeed,—for success in any such
case is always a failure. If the parent really wills
that the child shall do right, the parent’s endeavor
should be to have the child will in the same direction.
Merely to force one will into subjection to
the other is, however, an injury both to the one
who forces and to the one who submits.</p>

<p>A hypothetical illustration may make this matter
clearer. A father says to his strong-willed child:
“Johnny, shut that door.” Johnny says, “I won’t.”
The father says, “You shall.” Johnny rejoins, “I
won’t.” An issue is here made between two wills—the
father’s and the son’s. Many a parent would
suppose that in such a case the child’s will ought
to be broken, subjugated, forced, if need be, under
the pressure of the father’s will; and the more
conscientious the parent, the firmer is likely to be
his conviction of duty accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is at such a point as this that the evil of breaking
a child’s will, instead of training it, finds its
foothold in many a Christian home. The father is
determined not to yield his will to his child’s will.
The child is determined not to yield his will to his
father’s will. It is the old conflict between “an
irresistible force and an immovable body.” In such
a case, brute force may compel the child to do that
which he chooses not to do, just as the rack and
thumb-screws of the Inquisition could compel the
tortured one to deny a belief which he chooses to
adhere to; but in the one case, as in the other, the
victim of the torturing pressure is permanently
harmed, while the cause of truth and right has
been in no sense the gainer by the triumph.
Oh, what if God should treat his children in
that way!</p>

<p>What, then, it may be asked, should be done
with such a child in an issue like this? It certainly
would have been better, it would have been
far better, for the parent not to make a direct issue
by following the child’s first refusal with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
unqualified declaration, “You shall.” But with
the issue once made, however unfortunately, then
what? Let the parent turn to the child in loving
gentleness,—not <i>then</i> in severity, and never, never,
never in <i>anger</i>,—and tell him tenderly of a better
way than that which he is pursuing, urging him to
a wiser, nobler choice. In most cases the very
absence of any show of angry conflict on the
father’s part will prompt the child to choose to do
that which he said he would not do. But if worst
comes to worst (for we are here taking the extremest
supposable issue, which ought indeed rarely, if
ever, to occur), let the parent say to the child:
“Johnny, I shall have to give you your choice in
this matter. You can either shut that door or
take a whipping.” Then a new choice is before
the boy, and his will is free and unbroken for
its meeting.</p>

<p>Be it understood, the father has no right to say,
“I will whip you until you shut that door;” for
that would be to deprive the boy of a choice, to
deprive the boy of his will-power in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of his action: and that no parent is ever justified
in doing. If the boy chooses to be whipped rather
than to obey, the father must accept the result so
far, and begin again for the next time; although,
of course, there must be no undue severity in a
child’s punishment; even the civil law forbids that.
The father as a father is not entitled to have his
will stand in the place of his child’s will; even
though he is privileged to strive to bring the child
to will in the same direction that the father’s will
trends.</p>

<p>All the way along through his training-life, a
child ought to know what are to be the legitimate
consequences of his chosen action, in every case,
and then be privileged to choose accordingly.
There is a place for punishment in a child’s training,
but punishment is a penalty attached to a
choice; it is not brute force applied to compel
action against choice. No child ought ever to be
punished, unless he understood, when he chose to
do the wrong in question, that he was thereby
incurring the penalty of that punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>In most cases it is better, as has been said, for a
parent to <i>avoid</i> a direct issue with a child, than to
seek, or even than to recognize and meet, an issue.
And in the endeavor to train a child’s will, there is
often a gain in giving the child an alternative consequence
of obedience or disobedience. <i>That</i> is
God’s way of holding out rewards and punishments.
For example, a wise young mother was
just giving her little boy a bit of candy which was
peculiarly prized by him, when, in speaking to a
lady visitor he called her by the familiar term used
by older members of the family in addressing her.
The mother reminded him of the manner in which
he should speak to the lady. He refused to conform
to this. “Then I cannot let you have this
candy,” said the mother. “All right,” was the
wilful reply. “I’d rather go without the candy
than call her what you tell me to.” The mother
turned quietly away, taking the candy with her.
An hour later that child came to his mother, saying,
“Mamma, perhaps you can give me that candy
now; for I will always call that lady just what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
tell me to.” A few added words from the mother
at that juncture settled that point for all time.
Thenceforward the child did as he had thus been
led to will to do. His will had not been broken,
but it had been newly directed by judicious training.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, if a child be told by his
mother to leave the room, at a time when it is peculiarly
important that he should not remain there, and
he says that he will not go, what shall be done with
him? Shall he be permitted to have his own way,
against his own true welfare? If the chief point
be to get him out of the room, and there is no time
just then for his training, the child can be carried
out by main strength. But that neither breaks nor
trains the child’s will. It is not a triumph of will,
but of muscle. The child, in such a case, leaves
the room against his will, and in spite of it. His
will has simply been ignored, not broken. And
there are times when a child’s bodily removal from
one place to another is more important for the time
being than is, just then, the child’s will-training.
Such would be the case if the house were on fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
or if the child were taken suddenly ill. But that
is apart from the question of will-training or will-breaking.
The distinction here noted ought not to
be lost sight of in considering this question.</p>

<p>If, however, in the case above cited, the purpose
of the mother be to meet the issue which is there
raised, and to have it settled once for all whose
will shall triumph, right or wrong, the mother can
bring the pressure of brute force to bear on the
child’s will, in order to its final breaking. Under
that pressure, the child’s life may go out before his
will is broken. In many an instance of that sort,
this has been the result. Or, again, the child’s will
may then be broken. If it be so, the child is
harmed for life; and so is his mother. The one
has come into a slavish submission to the conscientiously
tyrannical demands of the other. Both
have obtained wrong conceptions of parental
authority, wrong conceptions of filial obedience,
and wrong conceptions of the plan and methods
of the Divine-Paternal government. But if, on the
other hand, now be the time for teaching a child to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
use his own will aright, at the summons of one
who is older and wiser than himself, and who is
over him in the plan of God for his guidance and
training, there is a better way than either the forcing
a child out of the room against his will, or the
breaking of his will so that that will is powerless
to prompt him to stay or to go.</p>

<p>The course to be pursued in this case is that
already suggested in the case of the child whose
father told him to shut the door. Let the mother
give herself, at once, to firm and gentle endeavors
to bring that child to use his own will, freely and
gladly, in the direction of her commands to him.
If necessary, let there be no more of sleeping or
eating in that home until that child, under the
forceful pressure of wise counsel and of affectionate
entreaty, has willed to do that which he ought to
do,—has willed to be an obedient child. Here,
again, is the difference between the wise training
of the will, and the always unwise and unjustifiable
breaking of the will.</p>

<p>Even in the matter of dealing with the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
animals, it has been found that the old idea of
“breaking” the will as a substitute for, or as a
necessary precedent of, the “training” the will, is
an erroneous one; and the remarkable power of
such horse-trainers as Rarey and Gleason grows
out of the fact that they are <i>trainers</i>, and not
<i>breakers</i>, of horses. A standard work on Dog
Training, by S. T. Hammond, is based on the idea,
indicated in one of its titles, of “Training <i>versus</i>
Breaking.” It might seem, indeed, that the counsel
of this latter writer, concerning the wise treatment
of a young dog taken newly in hand for his training,
were given to a parent concerning the wise
treatment of a young child when first taken in
hand for this purpose.</p>

<p>“Do not fail to abundantly caress him and speak
kindly words,” he says; “and never under any
circumstances, no matter what the provocation,
allow yourself to scold, or [in this early stage]
strike him, as this is entirely at variance with our
system, and is sure to result in the defeat of our
plans.... Be very gentle with him at all times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Carefully study his disposition, and learn all of
his ways, that you may the more readily understand
just how to manage him. You should be in
perfect sympathy with him, and humor all his
whims and notions, and endeavor to teach him that
you truly love him. In a short time you will find
that this love will be returned tenfold, and that he
is ever anxiously watching for your coming, and
never so happy as when in your presence and
enjoying your caresses.” This, be it borne in
mind, is in a line of work that seeks to bring the
entire will of the trained in loving subjection to
the will of the trainer. And that which is none
too high a standard for a young dog ought not
to be deemed too high for attainment by a rational
child.</p>

<p>Surely that which is found to be the best way for
a trainer of dogs on the one hand, and which, on
the other hand, is God’s way with all his children,
may fairly be recognized as both practicable and
best for a human parent’s dealing with his intelligent
little ones. And all this is written by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
who in well-nigh forty years of parental life has
tried more than one way in child-training, and
who long ago learned by experience as well as by
study that God’s way in this thing is unmistakably
the best way.</p>

<i>THE PLACE OF “MUST” IN
TRAINING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>With all the modern improvements in methods
of dealing with children,—and these improvements
are many and great,—it is important to bear in
mind that judicious <i>discipline</i> has an important
part in the wise training of the young. Discipline
is not everything in the sphere of child-training;
but discipline is much, in that sphere. Discipline
is an important factor in will-training; and will-training
is an important factor in wise child-training,
although will-breaking is not.</p>

<p>Formerly, discipline was the great feature, if not,
indeed, the only feature, in the training of children.
There was a time when children were not allowed
to sit in the presence of their parents, or to speak
to them unless they were first spoken to, or to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a place with their parents at the home table or in
the church pew; when the approved mode of teaching
was a primitive and very simple one. “They
told a child to learn; and if he did not, they beat
him.” The school-days of children were then
spoken of as “when they were under the rod.”
Even the occasional celebration of a holy day did
not bring unalloyed delight to the little ones; as,
for instance, “on Innocents’ Day, an old custom of
our ancestors was to flog the poor children in
their beds, not as a punishment, but to impress on
their minds the murder of the innocents.”</p>

<p>But all this is in the long past. For a century
or more the progress of interest in and attention
to the children has been steady and rapid. And
now the best talent of the world is laid under contribution
for the little ones. In the provisions of
song and story and pictures and toys and games,
as well as in school buildings and school appliances
and school methods, the place of the children
is foremost. At home they certainly do not
hesitate to sit down when and where they please,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
or to speak without waiting to be spoken to. Indeed,
there are parents who wonder if <i>they</i> will
ever get a chance to sit down while their children
are in the house; or if ever those children will
stop asking questions. Meanwhile in secular
schools and in Sunday-schools the aim seems to
be to make learning as attractive as possible to
children, and to relieve study, as far as may be, of
all tediousness and discomfort.</p>

<p>Now, that this state of things is, on the whole, a
decided improvement over that which it displaced,
there is no room for fair doubt. Yet there is
always a danger of losing sight of one important
truth in the effort to give new and due prominence
to another. Hence attention should be given to
the value of judicious discipline in the training of
children. Children need to learn how to do things
which they do not want to do, when those things
ought to be done. Older people have to do a
great many things from a sense of duty. Unless
children are trained to recognize duty as more
binding than inclination, they will suffer all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
lives through from their lack of discipline in this
direction.</p>

<p>Children ought to be trained to get up in the
morning at a proper hour, for some other reason
than that this is to be “the maddest, merriest day
in all the glad new year.” They ought to learn to
go to bed at a fitting time, whether they are sleepy
or not. Their hours of eating, and the quality and
quantity of their food, ought to be regulated by
some other standard than their inclinations. In
their daily life there must be a place for tasks as
tasks, for times of study under the pressure of
stern duty, in the effort to train them to do their
right work properly. It is not enough to have
children learn only lessons which they enjoy, and
this at times and by methods which are peculiarly
pleasing to them. President Porter, of Yale, said,
in substance, that the chief advantage of the college
curriculum is, that it trains a young man to
do what he ought to do, when he ought to do it,
whether he wants to do it or not. Any course of
training for a young person that fails to accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>plish
thus much, is part of a sadly imperfect
system.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, children who do not need
to be trained to apply themselves earnestly to occupations
which they dislike. The tastes of some
children are very good, and of others very poor;
but nearly all children have positive inclinations in
one direction or in another. They like playing
better than working or reading; or they prefer
reading or working to playing. Some prefer to
remain indoors; others prefer to be outside. Some
want to occupy themselves always in mechanical
pursuits; others would always be at games of one
sort or another. Some enjoy being with companions;
others prefer to be by themselves; yet
others would attach themselves to one or two persons
only, having little care for the society of anybody
else. In their studies, children show, perhaps
very early, a decided fancy for geography, or history
or mathematics, or the languages, and a pronounced
distaste for other branches of learning.
Now, whether a child’s tastes are elevated or unre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>fined,
in the direction of better or more undesirable
pursuits, he ought not to be permitted to follow
always his own fancies, or to do only that which
he really likes to do.</p>

<p>The parent or the teacher must decide what pursuit
of activity, or what branch of study, is best for
each several child, and must train him to it accordingly.
In making this decision, it is important to
consider fully the tastes and peculiarities of the
particular child under training; but the decision
itself must rest with the guardian rather than with
the child. Whatever place “elective” studies may
properly have in a university curriculum, there is
need of positive limitations to the elective system
of duties in the nursery and in the home sphere
generally.</p>

<p>Hardly anything can be more important in the
mental training of a child than the bringing him
to do what he ought to do, and to do it in its
proper time, whether he enjoys doing it or not.
The measure of a child’s ability to do this becomes
in the long run, the measure of his practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
efficiency in whatever sphere of life he labors.
No man can work always merely in the line of his
personal preferences. He must do many things
which are distasteful to him. Unless he was
trained as a child to do such things persistently,
he cannot do them to advantage when they are
upon him as a necessity. Nor can any man do
his best work as well as he ought to, if he works
always and only in one line. A one-sided man is
not a well-balanced man, even though his one side
be the right side. It is better to use the dextral
hand than the sinister, but it is certainly preferable
to be ambidextrous.</p>

<p>There is little danger that intelligent Christian
parents or teachers will at this day refuse to consider
duly a child’s tastes and peculiarities, in their
efforts to instruct and train him. While, however,
they are making study attractive and life enjoyable
to a child, parents should see to it that the child
learns to keep quiet at specified times, and to be
active at other times; that he studies assigned lessons,
does set tasks, denies himself craved indul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>gences;
that he goes and comes, that he stands
or moves, at designated hours,—not because he
wants to do these things, but because he <i>must</i>.
Now, as of old, “it is good for a man that he bear
the yoke in his youth.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>VII.<br /><br />

<i>DENYING A CHILD WISELY.</i></h2></div>


<p>One of the hardest and one of the most important
things in the training of a loved child is to
deny him that which he longs for, and which we
could give to him, but which he would better not
have. It is very pleasant to gratify a child. There
is real enjoyment in giving to him what he asks for,
when we can do it prudently. But wise withholding
is quite as important as generous giving in the
proper care of a child.</p>

<p>Next to denying a child necessary food and
raiment, for the sustenance of very life, the unkindest
treatment of a child is to give him everything
that he asks for. Every parent recognizes
this truth within certain limits, and therefore refuses
an unsheathed knife, or a percussion cartridge, or
a cup of poison, to a child who cries for it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the breadth and the full significance of the principle
involved are not so generally accepted as
they should be.</p>

<p>A child ought to be denied, by his parents, many
things which in themselves are harmless. It is an
injury to any child to have always at the table the
dishes which he likes best; to have uniformly the
cut or the portion which he prefers; to have every
plaything which his parents can afford to give
him; to dress—even within their means—just as
he wants to; and to go, with them, where and
when he pleases. That child who has never a
legitimate desire ungratified is poorly fitted for the
duties and the trials of every-day life in the world.
He does not, indeed, enjoy himself now as he might
hope to through a different training. It is sadly
to a parent’s discredit when a child can truly say,
“My father, or my mother, never denied me any
pleasure which it was fairly in his, or her, power
to bestow.”</p>

<p>It is because of the evil results of not wisely
denying the little ones, that an only child is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
so many instances spoken of as a spoiled child.
There is but one to give to in that household. He
can have just so much more, than if there were
half a dozen children to share it; and, as a rule,
he gets it all. Parents give to him freely; so do
grandparents, and so do uncles and aunts. He
hardly knows what self-denial or want is. His
very fullness palls upon him. It is not easy to
surprise him with an unexpected pleasure. He
not only is liable to grow selfish and exacting,
but at the best he lacks all the enjoyment which
comes of the occasional gratification of a desire
which has been long felt without the expectation
of its being speedily met.</p>

<p>But it is by no means <i>necessary</i> that an only
child should be spoiled in training. Some of the
best trained children in the world have been only
children. Many a parent is more faithful and discreet
in securing to his or her only child the benefits
of self-denial than is many another with half a
dozen children to care for. But whether there be
one child or more in the family, the lesson of wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
denial is alike important to the young, and the responsibility
of its teaching should be recognized
by the parent.</p>

<p>Few grown persons can have everything they
want, everything that love can give, everything
that money can buy. Most of them have many
reasonable wishes ungratified, many moderate desires
unfilled. They have to get along without a
great many things which others have, and which
they would like. It is probable that their children
will be called to similar experiences when they
must finally shift for themselves. Their children
ought, therefore, to be in training for this experience
now. It is largely the early education which
gives one proper control over himself and his
desires. If in childhood one is taught to deny
himself, to yield gracefully much that he longs for,
to enjoy the little that he can have in spite of the
lack of a great deal which he would like to have,
his lot will be an easier and a happier one, when
he comes to the realities of maturer life, than would
be possible to him if, as a child, he had only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
express a reasonable wish, to have it promptly
gratified.</p>

<p>For this reason it is that men who were the children
of the rich are so often at a disadvantage, in
the battle of life, in comparison with those who have
risen from comparative poverty. Their parents’
wealth, so freely at their disposal, increased the number
of wants which they now think must be gratified;
and their pampering in childhood so enervated
them for the struggles and endurances which
are, at the best, a necessity in ordinary business
pursuits, that they are easily distanced by those
who were in youth disciplined through enforced
self-denial, and made strong by enduring hardness,
and by finding contentment with a little. It
is a great pity that the full and free gifts of a loving
parent should prove a hindrance to a child’s happiness,
a barrier to his success in life; that the very
abundance of the parent’s giving should tend to
the child’s poverty and unhappiness! Yet this
state of things is in too many instances an undeniable
fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Children of the present day—especially children
of parents in comfortable worldly circumstances—are
far more likely than were their fathers and
mothers to lack lessons of self-denial. The standard
of living is very different now from a generation
since. There were few parents in any community
in this country fifty years ago who could
buy whatever they wanted for their children; or,
indeed, for themselves. There was no such freeness
of purchases for children, for the table, for the
house or the household, as is now common on
every side. Children then did not expect a new
suit of clothes every few months. Often they had
old ones made over for them, from those of their
parents or of their elder brothers and sisters. A
present from the toy-shop or bookstore was a
rarity in those days. There was not much choosing
by children what they would eat as they sat
down at the family table. There was still less of
planning by them for a summer journey with their
parents to a mountain or seaside resort. Self-denial,
or more or less of personal privation, came as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
necessity to almost every child in the younger days
of many who are now on the stage of active life.
But how different now!</p>

<p>The average child of the present generation receives
more presents and more indulgences from
his parents in any one year of his life than the
average child of a generation ago received in all
the years of his childhood. Because of this new
standard, the child of to-day expects new things,
as a matter of course; he asks for them, in the
belief that he will receive them. In consequence
of their abundance, he sets a smaller value upon
them severally. It is not possible that he should
think as highly of any one new thing, out of a hundred
coming to him in rapid succession, as he would
of the only gift of an entire year.</p>

<p>A boy of nowadays can hardly prize his new
bicycle, or his “double-ripper” sled, after all the
other presents he has received, as his father prized
a little wagon made of a raisin-box, with wheels of
ribbon-blocks, which was <i>his</i> only treasure in the
line of locomotion. A little girl cannot have as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
profound enjoyment in her third wax doll of the
year, with eyes which open and shut, as her mother
had with her one clumsy doll of stuffed rags or of
painted wood. A new child’s book was a wonder
a generation since; it is now hardly more to one
of our children than the evening paper is to the
father of the family. It is now hard work to give
a new sensation—or, at all events, to make a permanent
impression—by the bestowal of a gift of
any sort on a child. It would be far easier to
surprise and to impress many a child by refusing
to give to him what he asked for and expected;
and that treatment would in some cases be greatly
to a child’s advantage.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the child-training of the
ancient Spartans was the rigid discipline of constant
self-denial, to which the child was subjected
from infancy onward. And this feature of child-training
among that people had much to do with
giving to the Spartans their distinguishing characteristics
of simplicity of manners, of powers of
endurance, and of dauntless bravery. The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
primitive peoples everywhere have recognized the
pre-eminent importance of this feature of child-training.
Its neglect has come only with the
growth in luxury among peoples of the highest
material civilization. The question is an important
one, whether it is well to lose all the advantages
of this method of training, simply because
it is not found to be a necessity as a means of
sustaining physical life, where wealth abounds
so freely.</p>

<p>It is not that a child is to be denied what he
wants, merely for the sake of the denial itself; but
it is that a child ought not to have what he wants
merely because he wants it. It is not that there
is a necessary gain in a denial to a child; but it is
that when a denial to a child is necessary, there is
an added gain to him through his finding that he
must do without what he longs for. It is every
parent’s duty to deny a child many things which
he wants; to teach him that he must get along
without a great many things which seem very
desirable; to train him to self-denial and endur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ance,
at the table, in the play-room; with companions,
and away from them: and the doing of
this duty by the parent brings a sure advantage to
the child. Whatever else he has, a child ought
not to lack this element of a wise training.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>VIII.<br /><br />

<i>HONORING A CHILD’S INDIVIDUALITY.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A child is liable to be looked upon as if he were
simply one child among many children, a specimen
representative of childhood generally; but
every child stands all by himself in the world as
an individual, with his own personality and character,
with his own thoughts and feelings, his own
hopes and fears and possibilities, his own relations
to his fellow-beings and to God. This truth is
often realized by a child before his parents realize
it; and if it be unperceived and unrecognized by
his parents, they are thereby shut off from the
opportunity of doing for him much that can be
done by them only as they give due honor to their
child’s individuality as a child.</p>

<p>A little babe is not a mere bit of child-material,
to be worked up by outside efforts and influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
into a child-reality; but he is already a living
organism, with all the possibilities of his highest
manhood working within him toward their independent
development. Here is the difference, on a
lower plane, between a mass of clay being molded
by the sculptor’s hands into a statue of grace and
beauty, and a seed of herb or tree containing
within itself the germ of a new and peculiar individual
specimen of its own unchanging species.
An acorn is more than the fruit of the oak that
bore it; it is the germ of another oak, like, and yet
unlike, all the oaks that the world has known
before the growth of this one. So, also, a child is
more than the mere child of his earthly parents;
he is, in embryo, a man with characteristics and
qualities such as his parents could never attain to,
and which, it may be, the world has never before
seen equaled.</p>

<p>The possibilities of Moses, who was to put his
impress upon the world’s character, were in the
Hebrew babe, as his loving mother laid him tenderly
in the pitch-daubed basket of papyrus, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
hide him away among the flags of the Nile-border,
as they were not in any native babe of the household
of Pharaoh; and if his mother had any intuitive
womanly sense of his grand future in the
providence of God, her zeal and faith in his behalf
were quickened and inspired accordingly. And so
it has been all along the ages; the germs of power
and achievement were already in the babe, who was
afterward known as Plato, or Cæsar, or Muhammad,
or Charlemagne, or Columbus, or Shakespeare, or
Washington. And who will doubt that many a
germ of such possibility in a young child has been
quickened or repressed, according as that child’s
parents have perceived and honored, or have failed
to realize and to foster, the best that was involved
in the child’s individuality?</p>

<p>It was to the credit of the high-priest Eli, that
he perceived that the child Samuel was capable of
receiving communications from the Lord, such as
were denied to the possessor of Urim and Thummim;
and that he honored the child’s individuality
so far as to encourage him to declare the message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that God had sent by him; instead of treating the
child as one who could receive nothing from God,
save as it came to him through the medium of his
guardians and seniors. This spirit it was that
prompted Trebonius to bare his head as he entered
the school-room where he was looked up to as the
teacher; because, as he suggested, he recognized
in every child before him there the possibility of
lofty attainment in his developed individuality.
And it can hardly be doubted that this attitude of
the teacher Trebonius had its measure of influence
in bringing to its fruition the germinal power
in his pupil Martin Luther. Trebonius and Eli
are—so far, at least—a pattern to the parents of
to-day.</p>

<p>It is not merely that the child <i>is to be</i> the possessor
of a marked and distinctive individuality,
and that therefore he is to be honored for his possibilities
in that direction; but it is that <i>he already is</i>
the possessor of such an individuality, and that he
is worthy of honor for that which he has and is at
the present time. Many a child, while a child, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the superior of his parents in the basis and scope
of character, in the attributes of genius, and in the
instincts of high spiritual perception. This is the
true order of things in the progress of God’s plans
for the race; the better is in the coming generations,
not in the past. But even where the child is
not the superior, he is always the peer in individuality
of those to whom he looks up with honoring
reverence as his parents, and he is entitled to recognition
by them in that peership.</p>

<p>Every one who recalls clearly his child-time
thoughts and feelings, remembers that even in his
earliest days he had his own standpoint of observation
and reflection; that he was conscious of his
individual relations to others and to God; and that,
in a sense, his independent outlook and his independent
uplook as an individual were the same then
as now, in kind, although not in degree. He also
remembers that, as a child, he was often made to
feel that his individuality was not fully recognized
by others, but that it was frequently ignored or
trenched upon by those who took it for granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that, because he was still a child, he had as yet no
truly individual position, attitude, and rights in the
world. Yet it is not an easy thing for a parent of
to-day to bear always in mind that every child of
his is as truly an individual as he was when he was
a child.</p>

<p>In little things, as in larger, a child’s individuality
is liable to be overlooked, or to be disregarded.
A little boy was taken alarmingly ill one day. For
several hours his loving mother watched him anxiously.
The next day he was in his accustomed
health again. His mother, with the evident thought
that a child could have no comprehension like a
parent’s of such a state of things as that, said to
him, tenderly: “My dear boy, you don’t know
how sick you were yesterday.” “Oh, yes! I do,
dear mamma,” he answered; “I know a great deal
better than you do; for I was the one that was
sick.” And many a child has the thought that was
in that child’s mind, when he is spoken to as
though he must get all his ideas of his own feelings
and conditions and needs from some one who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
supposed to represent him better than he can represent
himself—while he is still in childhood.</p>

<p>It is much the same in the matter of personal
rights, as in the matter of personal feelings. A
child finds that his individuality is constantly lost
sight of, because he is a child; as it ought not to
be. A little fellow who had been given a real
watch, was conscious of an advance in his relative
position by that possession. His uncle, having
taken his own watch to the watchmaker’s, asked
the loan of the little fellow’s watch for the time
being, saying that he could not get along without
one. “Can’t you get along without a watch?”
asked the nephew. “No, I cannot,” replied the
uncle. “If I had mine at the watchmaker’s, would
you lend me yours till mine came back?” was the
little fellow’s searching inquiry. “Why, no; I
don’t suppose I would,” replied the other. “But
then, you know, I’m a man, and you are a boy.”
“Well, then,” said the individual boy to the individual
man; “if you can’t get along without a
watch, and you wouldn’t lend me yours if I needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
it, I can’t get along without a watch, and I can’t
let you have mine.”</p>

<p>Now, the trouble in that case was that the boy’s
individuality was not sufficiently recognized and
honored by the manner of that request for his
watch. It seemed to be taken for granted that,
because he was a child, he had no such rights in
his own possessions as a man has in his, and that
he put no such value on that which he had, as a
man would be sure to put on his belongings.
Against that assumption the child quite naturally,
and with a good show of logic, resolutely asserted
himself. If, on the other hand, the boy had been
appealed to as an equal, to render a favor to the
other because of a special and a clearly explained
need, there is no reason to doubt that he would
have been prompt to respond to it, with a feeling
of satisfaction in being able to render that favor.</p>

<p>Just here is where so many children are
deprived of their rights as individuals, by inconsiderate
parents or others. When seats are lacking
for new comers in a room or a street-car, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
or three children are seated together by themselves
in absorbing chat, the temptation is to speak
quickly to the little ones, telling them to vacate
those seats for their elders, in a tone that seems to
indicate that a child has no rights in comparison
with a grown person; instead of showing by the
very manner of address that the children’s attention
is called to their privilege of showing courtesy to
their elders. In the one case, every child of that
party feels aggrieved through being made to feel
that his rights are not recognized as rights. In
the other case, he is gratified by the implied confidence
in his gentlemanliness, and in his readiness
to yield his rights gracefully. A child’s rights as
an individual are as positive and as sacred as a
man’s; and it is never proper to ignore these rights
in a child, any more than it would be in a man.</p>

<p>When a child shows an unexpected interest in a
subject of conversation between adults, it is not
fair for the adults to brush aside the child’s questions
or comments in a way that seems to say, “Oh!
you are only a child. Your opinions are of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
account. This is a matter for real people to think
and talk about.” Yet how common a thing it is
for parents to treat their children in this way; and
what a mistake it is! If, indeed, the subject be one
that is fairly beyond a child’s grasp, it is quite
proper to give the child to understand this fact,
without any lack of respect for his individuality;
but under no circumstances is it right to ignore
that individuality at such a time.</p>

<p>The deeper the theme of converse, and the profounder
the thought involved in it, the greater the
probability of a child’s freshness and life in its considering,
if he indicates an appreciative interest in
its discussion. It is not merely in the story of the
child Samuel that there is a gleam of childhood’s
possibilities in the direction of closer communion
with God than is granted to ordinary manhood;
but all the teachings of Scripture and of human
experience tend to the disclosure and confirmation
of this same truth. “Verily I say unto you,” says
our Lord, “Except ye turn, and become as little
children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of heaven.” And again: “See that ye despise not
one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that
in heaven their angels do always behold the face of
my Father which is in heaven.” And there is an
echo of these Divine words in the familiar teachings
of the Christian poet of nature:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Heaven lies about us in our infancy!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Shades of the prison-house begin to close</div>
<div class="line i1">Upon the growing Boy,</div>
<div class="line">But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,—</div>
<div class="line i1">He sees it in his joy;</div>
<div class="line">The Youth, who daily farther from the East</div>
<div class="line">Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,</div>
<div class="line i1">And by the vision splendid</div>
<div class="line i1">Is on his way attended;</div>
<div class="line">At length the Man perceives it die away,</div>
<div class="line">And fade into the light of common day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is, indeed, a possibility of retaining the
child-freshness of acquaintance with spiritual truths
even into manhood and through all one’s life.
That possibility every parent ought to strive to
attain to. “Whosoever therefore shall humble
himself as this little child,” said our Lord, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
pointed to a veritable human little one, “the same
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” And
he who is greatest through being most child-like,
will be readiest to recognize the individuality and
the glorious possibilities of each and every child
committed to his charge. Even while training a
child, he will learn from the child; and so he and
his child will grow together toward the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ.</p>

<i>LETTING ALONE AS A MEANS
OF CHILD-TRAINING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Not doing is always as important, in its time
and place, as doing; and this truth is as applicable
in the realm of child-training as elsewhere.
Child-training is a necessity, but there is a danger
of over-doing in the line of child-training. The
neglect of child-training is a great evil. Over-doing
in the training of a child may be even a
greater evil. Both evils ought to be avoided. In
order to their avoidance, their existence and limits
as evils must be recognized.</p>

<p>Peculiarly is it the case that young parents who
are exceptionally conscientious, and exceptionally
desirous of being wise and faithful in the discharge
of their parental duties, are liable to err in the
direction of over-doing in the training of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
children. It is not that they are lacking in love
and tenderness toward their little ones, or that
they are naturally inclined to severity as disciplinarians;
but it is that their mistaken view of the
methods and limitations of wise child-training impels
them to an injudicious course of watchful
strictness with their children, even while that course
runs counter to their affections and desires as
parents. Their very love and fidelity cause them
to harm their children by over-doing in their
training, even more than the children of parents
less wise and faithful are harmed by a lack of systematic
training. It is, in fact, because they are
so desirous of well-doing, that these parents over-do
in the line of their best endeavors for their
children.</p>

<p>A young father who was an earnest student of
methods of child-training, and who sincerely desired
to be faithful in the training of his first child
at any cost to his feelings of loving tenderness
toward that child, made a mistake in this direction,
and received a lesson accordingly. His child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
as full of affection as she was of life and spirit.
She had not yet learned what she might do and
what she might not do, but she was rapidly developing
impulses and tastes in various directions;
and her strength of personal character was showing
itself in her positiveness of purpose in the line
of her tastes and impulses for the hour. Her
father had heard much about the importance of
parental training and discipline, but had heard
nothing about the danger of over-doing in this
line; hence he deemed it his duty to be constantly
directing or checking his child, so as to
keep her within the limits of safety and duty as
he saw it.</p>

<p>To his surprise and regret, the father found that,
while his little daughter was not inclined to waywardness
or disobedience, she was steadily coming
into a state of chronic resistance to his attempts at
her stricter governing. This resistance was passive
rather than active, but it was none the less real
for that. She would not refuse to obey, but she
would not be ready or prompt to obey. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
not be aroused to anger or show any open sign of
disrespect, but she would seem unable or unwilling
to act as she was told to. Kind words and earnest
entreaties were of no avail at this point, neither
were they ever resented or explicitly rejected. If
punishment was attempted, she submitted to it with
a good grace, but it seemed to have no effect in
the way of removing the cause of original trouble.
The father never, indeed, lost his temper, or grew
less loving toward his child; he prayed for guidance,
and he gave his best thoughts to the problem
before him; but all to no apparent purpose. The
matter grew more and more serious, and he was
more and more bewildered.</p>

<p>One day, after a serious struggle with his little
daughter over a matter that would have been a
trifling one except as it bore on the question of
her character and welfare, the father left his house
with a heavy heart, and almost in despair over this
question of wise child-training. At the door he
met a friend, much older than himself, with whom
he had been a co-worker in several spheres of Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tian
activity. Seeing his troubled face, that friend
asked him the cause of his evident anxiety, and the
young father opened his heart, and told the story of
his trouble. “Isn’t the trouble, that you are over-doing
in the training of your child?” asked the
listener; and then he went on to give his own
experience in illustration of the meaning of this
question.</p>

<p>“My first child was my best child,” he said;
“and I harmed her for life by over-doing in her
training, as I now see, in looking back over my
course with her. I thought I must be training her
all the time, and I forced issues with her, and took
notice of little things, when I would have done
better to let her alone. So she was checked unduly,
and shut up within herself by my course
with her; and she grew up in a rigid and unnatural
constraint which ought not to have been hers.
I saw my mistake afterwards, and I allowed my
other children more freedom, by letting them alone
except when they must be interfered with; and
I’ve seen the benefit of this course. My rule with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
all my children, since my first, has been to avoid
an issue with them on a question of discipline
whenever I could do so safely. And the less
show of training there is, in bringing up a child,
the better, as I see it.”</p>

<p>This was a revelation to that young father. He
determined at once to try to act on its suggestions,
since the opposite course had been such a signal
failure in his hands. When again in his home, an
opportunity for an experiment was soon before
him. His little daughter came into the room,
through a door which she had been repeatedly
told to push to, after she had passed it. Without
any special thought on the subject, the father,
who sat writing at his desk, said, as often before:
“Push the door to, darling.” And, as often before,
the child stood quiet and firm, as if in expectation
of a new issue on that point. The counsel of the
morning came into the father’s mind, and he said
gently, “You needn’t shut the door to, darling, if
you don’t want to. Papa will do it,” and at once
he stepped and closed the door, returning after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>wards
to his desk, without a word of rebuke to
his child.</p>

<p>This was a new experience to the poor overtaxed
child. She stood in perplexed thought for
a few minutes. Then she came lovingly to her
father, and, asking to be taken up on his knee, she
clasped her arms about his neck, and said: “Dear
papa, I’m sorry I didn’t shut that door. I will next
time. Please forgive me, dear papa.” And that
was the beginning of a new state of things in that
home. The father had learned that there was a
danger of over-doing in the work of child-training,
and his children were afterwards the gainers by
his added knowledge of the needs and tastes of
childhood.</p>

<p>In the case of this father, the trouble had been
that he made too many direct issues with his child
on questions of authority and obedience, and that
thus he provoked conflicts which might have been
wisely avoided. After this new experience he was
very cautious at this point, and he soon found that
his child could be trained to obey without so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
considering the possibility of resisting or questioning
parental authority. When, in any case, an
issue had to be accepted, the circumstances were
so well considered that the child as well as the
parent saw that its right outcome was the only
outcome. The error of this father had been the
error of a thoughtful and deliberate disciplinarian,
who was as yet but partially instructed; but there
are also thoughtless and inconsiderate parents
who harm, if they do not ruin, their children’s dispositions
by over-doing in what they call child-training.
And this error is even worse than
the other.</p>

<p>There are many parents who seem to suppose
that their chief work in the training of a child is
to be incessantly commanding or prohibiting; telling
the child to do this or to do that, and not to
do this, that, or the other. But this nagging a
child is not training a child; on the contrary, it is
destructive of all training on the part of him who
is addicted to it. It is not the driver who is training
a horse, but one who neither is trained nor can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
train, who is all the time “yanking” at the reins,
or “thrapping” them up and down. Neither
parent nor driver, in such a case, can do as much
in the direction of training by doing incessantly,
as by letting alone judiciously. “Don’t be always
don’t-ing,” is a bit of counsel to parents that can
hardly be emphasized too strongly. Don’t be
always directing, is a companion precept to this.
Both injunctions are needful, with the tendency
of human nature as it is.</p>

<p>Of course, there must be explicit commanding
and explicit prohibiting in the process of child-training;
but there must also be a large measure
of wise letting alone. When to prohibit and
when to command, in this process, are questions
that demand wisdom, thought, and character; and
more wisdom, more thought, and more character,
are needful in deciding the question when to let
the child alone. The training of a child must
go on incessantly; but a large share of the time
it will best go on by the operation of influences,
inspirations, and inducements, in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of a right standard held persistently before the
child, without anything being said on the subject
to the child at every step in his course of
progress. Doing nothing, as a child-trainer, is, in
its order, the best kind of doing.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>X.<br /><br />

<i>TRAINING A CHILD TO
SELF-CONTROL.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>An inevitable struggle between the individual and
the several powers that go to make his individuality,
begins in every child at his very birth, and
continues so long as his life in the flesh continues.
On the outcome of this struggle depends the ultimate
character of him who struggles. It is, to
him, bondage or mastery, defeat or triumph, failure
or success, as a result of the battling that cannot
be evaded. And, as a matter of fact, the issue
of the life-long battle is ordinarily settled in childhood.</p>

<p>A child who is trained to self-control—as a child
may be—is already a true man in his fitness for
manly self-mastery. A man who was not trained,
in childhood, to self-control, is hopelessly a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in his combat with himself; and he can never
regain the vantage-ground which his childhood
gave to him, in the battle which then opened before
him, and in the thick of which he still finds himself.
It is in a child’s earlier struggles with himself
that help can easiest be given to him, and that it is
of greatest value for his own developing of character.
Yet at that time a child has no such sense of
his need in this direction as is sure to be his in
maturer years; hence it is that it rests with the
parent to decide, while the child is still a child,
whether the child shall be a slave to himself, or a
master of himself; whether his life, so far, shall be
worthy or unworthy of his high possibilities of
manhood.</p>

<p>A child’s first struggle with himself ought to be
in the direction of controlling his impulse to give
full play to his lungs and his muscles at the
prompting of his nerves. As soon as the nerves
make themselves felt, they prompt a child to cry,
to thrash his arms, to kick, and to twist his body
on every side, at the slightest provocation,—or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
none. Unless this prompting be checked, the
child will exhaust himself in aimless exertion, and
will increase his own discomfort by the very means
of its exhibit. A control of himself at this point
is possible to a child, at an age while he is yet
unable to speak, or to understand what is spoken
to him. If a parent realizes that the child <i>must</i> be
induced to control himself, and seeks in loving
firmness to cause the child to realize that same
truth, the child will <i>feel</i> the parent’s conviction,
and will yield to it, even though he cannot comprehend
the meaning of his parent’s words as words.
The way of helping the child will be found, by the
parent who wills to help him. To leave a child to
himself in these earliest struggles with himself, is
to put him at a sad disadvantage in all the future
combats of his life’s warfare; while to give him
wise help in these earliest struggles, is to give him
help for all the following struggles.</p>

<p>As soon as a child is able to understand what is
said to him, he ought to be taught and trained to
control his impulse to cry and writhe under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
pressure of physical pain. When a child has fallen
and hurt himself, or has cut his finger, or has
burned his hand, or has been hit by an ill-directed
missile, it is natural for him to shriek with pain and
fright, and it is natural for his tender-hearted
mother to shrink from blaming him just then for
indulging in this display of grief. But even at such
a time as this, a mother has an unmistakable duty
of helping her child to gain a measure of control
over himself, so as to repress his cries and to moderate
his exhibit of disturbed feeling.</p>

<p>A child can come to exercise self-control under
such circumstances as these. His mother can
enable him to do this. It is better for both child
and mother that he should have her help accordingly.
Because of the lack of help just here,
many a child is a sufferer through life in his inability
to control himself under physical pain. And
because of this inability many a person has actually
lost his life, at a time when calmness of mind was
essential to that endurance of physical suffering
which was the only hope of prolonged existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Because he was not trained to control his nerves,
he is hopelessly controlled by his nerves.</p>

<p>Coaxing and rewarding a child into quiet at such
a time is not what is needed; but it is the encouraging
a child into an intelligent control of himself,
that is to be aimed at by the wise parent. It is
only a choice between evils that substitutes a candy-paid
silence for a noisy indulgence of feeling on a
child’s part. A good illustration of the unwise
way of inducing children to seem to have control
of themselves, is given in the familiar story of the
little fellow throwing himself on the floor and
kicking and yelling, and then crying out, “Grandma,
grandma, I want to be pacified. Where are
your sugar-plums?”</p>

<p>Dr. Bushnell, protesting against this method of
coaxing a child out of a state of irritation, in a fit
of ill-nature, by “dainties that please the taste,”
says forcefully, “It must be a very dull child that
will not cry and fret a great deal, when it is so
pleasantly rewarded. Trained, in this manner, to
play ill-nature for sensation’s sake, it will go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
rapidly, in the course of double attainment, and
will be very soon perfected in the double character
of an ill-natured, morbid sensualist, and a feigning
cheat besides. By what methods, or means, can
the great themes of God and religion get hold of
a soul that has learned to be governed only by
rewards of sensation, paid to affectations of grief
and deliberate actings of ill-nature?”</p>

<p>That control of himself which is secured by a
child in his intelligent repression of an impulse to
cry and writhe in physical pain, is of advantage to
the child in all his life-long struggle with himself;
and he should be trained in the habit of making
his self-control available to him in this struggle.
“I buffet my body [or give it a black eye] and
bring it into bondage; lest by any means, after that
I have preached to others, I myself should be
rejected,” says the Apostle Paul; as if in recognition
of the fact that a man’s battle with his body is
a vital conflict, all his life through. Every child
needs the help of his parents in gaining control
over his body, instead of allowing his body to gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the control of him. The appetites and passions
and impellings of the outer man are continually
striving for the mastery over the inner man; and
unless one is trained to master these instead of
being mastered by them, he is sure to fail in his
life-struggle.</p>

<p>A parent ought to help his child to refrain from
laughing when he ought not to laugh; from crying
when he ought not to cry; from speaking when he
ought not to speak; from eating that which he
ought not to eat, even though the food be immediately
before him; from running about when it is
better for him to remain quiet; and to be ready to
say and to do just that which it is best for him to
say and do, at the time when it needs to be said
and done. Self-control in all these things is possible
to a child. Wise training on the parent’s part
can secure it. The principle which is operative
here, is operative in every sphere of human existence.
By means of self-control a child is made
happier, and is fitted for his duties, while a child
and ever after, as otherwise he could not be. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a man’s life-course is saddened through his hopeless
lack of that self-control to which he could easily
have been helped in childhood, if only his parents

<i>TRAINING A CHILD NOT TO TEASE.</i></h2></div>


<p>A child who never “teases” is a rarity; yet no
child ought to tease. If a child does tease, the
blame of his teasing properly rests on his parents,
rather than on himself. The parent who realizes
this fact, will have an added stimulus to the work
of training his child not to tease; and no phase of
the work of child-training is simpler, or surer of its
result, than this one.</p>

<p>“To tease” is “to pull,” “to tug,” “to drag,” “to
vex [or carry] with importunity.” A child teases
when he wants something from his parents, and
fails to get it at the first asking. He pulls and
tugs at his parents, in the hope of dragging them
to his way of thinking, or to a consent to his having
what he wants in spite of their different thinking.
He hopes to vex or carry them into the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of his desires by means of his importunities, whatever
their view of the case may have been, to begin
with. If a child could have what he wanted at his
first asking, he would not tease; for there would be
no room for his teasing. If a child never secured
anything through teasing, he would not come into
the habit of teasing; for there would be no inducement
to him to tease. When, therefore, a child is
accustomed to tease, it is evident that he has been
trained by his parents to tease, instead of being
trained by them not to tease; and they are to bear
the responsibility and blame of his teasing.</p>

<p>Many a child does not expect to get what he
wants, if it is out of the ordinary line of his daily
needs, unless he teases for it; therefore he counts
teasing a part of his regular duty in life, as truly as
“beating down” the city shop-keeper on his prices
is supposed to be the duty of a shopper from the
country. If a child asks for a slice of bread-and-butter,
or a bit of meat, at the family table, or for
a glass of water between meals, he expects to get
it at the first asking. Teasing for that is not in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
mind as a necessity. But if he wants to stay at
home from school without any reason for it, or to
start off with some of his schoolmates on a long
and hazardous tramp on a Saturday, or to sit up an
hour later than usual at night, or to have a new
sled or velocipede or bicycle, or to go to the circus
or to hear the minstrels, “like all the other fellows,”—he
is not so sure of gaining his request
at the first asking. So, when the answer “No”
comes back to him, in such a case, he meets it
with the appeal, “Do let me. Oh, do!” and then
he enters upon a nerve struggle for the mastery
over his parents at this point, with the idea in his
mind that it is a single question of who shall
be most persistent in adhering to his side of
the conflict.</p>

<p>There are few children who always succeed in
carrying their point by teasing; but there are
fewer who never succeed by this means. Most
parents give way, sooner or later, in some of
these conflicts with their children. It may be
that they are less determined than their children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and that they are simply tired out by the teasing.
It may be that they are moved by their children’s
earnestness in the matter, and that they yield because
of their tenderness toward the little pleaders.
It may be that their first answer to the appeal is a
thoughtless one, and that their fuller considering
of the matter leads them to see it to be right to
reverse their impulsive decision. Whatever be the
parents’ reason for their course in such a case, if
they give a negative answer to their children’s first
request, and an affirmative one in response to more
or less teasing on the children’s part, they train
their children so far to believe that teasing is an
important factor in a child’s progress in life; and
of course they are responsible for their children’s
continuance in the habit of teasing.</p>

<p>It is a misfortune to a child to suppose that teasing
is essential to his gaining a point that he ought
to gain. A result of such a view in his mind is,
that he looks not to his parents’ wisdom and judgment,
but to his own positiveness and persistency,
as the guide of his action in any mooted case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
personal conduct; not to principles which are disclosed
to him by one who is in authority, but to
impulses which are wholly in his own bosom.
Such a view is inimical to all wise methods of
thinking and doing on a child’s part. And it is
even more of a misfortune to the parent than to
the child, for a child to have the idea that the
parent’s decision is a result of the child’s teasing,
rather than of the parent’s understanding of what
is right and best in a given case. No parent can
have the truest respect of a child, while the child
knows that he can tease that parent into compliance
with the child’s request, contrary to the parent’s
real or supposed conviction. For the child’s
sake, therefore, and also for the parent’s, every
child ought to be trained not to tease, and not
to expect any possible advantage from teasing.</p>

<p>Susannah Wesley, the mother of John and
Charles Wesley, was accustomed to say, of her
children, that they all learned very early that they
were not to have anything that they cried for, and
that so they soon learned not to cry for a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that they wanted. Who will doubt that John
and Charles Wesley were stronger men, for this
training, than they could have been if they were
trained to look upon crying as a means of securing
what was best for them? Who will doubt that
Susannah Wesley was more of a woman, and more
respected by her sons because of her unvarying
firmness at this point, than would have been possible
if she had frequently yielded to the pressure
of their piteous crying for that which it was against
her judgment to give to them? Any parent who
would apply this rule of Susannah Wesley to the
matter of teasing, might be sure of a corresponding
result in the children’s estimate of the practical
value of teasing. Any child who finds that he is
never to have anything for which he teases, will
quickly quit teasing. How simple this rule, for
this department of child-training!</p>

<p>Simple as it seems, however, to be uniformly
positive in refusing to give to a child anything for
which he teases, it is not an easy thing to adhere
to this rule, unvaryingly, and to do it wisely. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the trouble in the case is not with the child, but
with the parent. In order to give promptly, to a
child’s request, an answer that can rightly be insisted
upon against all entreaties, a parent must do
his thinking before he gives that answer, rather
than afterwards. Too often a parent denies a
child’s request at the start without considering
the case in all its bearings; and then, when the
child presses his suit, the parent sees reasons for
granting it which had not been in his mind before.
The child perceives this state of things, and
realizes that the question is to be settled by his
teasing, rather than by his parent’s independent
judgment; and that, therefore, teasing is the only
means of securing a correct decision in the premises.</p>

<p>Training a child not to tease, is a duty incumbent
upon every parent; but, as a prerequisite to this
training of the child, the parent must himself be
trained. When a child asks a favor of a parent,
the parent must not reply hastily, or thoughtlessly,
or without a full understanding of the case in all
its involvings. If necessary, he may question the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
child, in order to a better understanding of the
case, or he may postpone his answer until he can
learn more about it; but he must not be over
quick to reply merely as a means of pushing away
the request for the time being. He must consider
carefully what his final answer ought to be, before
he gives an answer that the child is to accept as
final; and when the parent gives that answer, it
ought to be with such kindly firmness that the
child will not think of pressing his suit by teasing.
And thus it is that any well-trained parent can
train his child well in this sphere.</p>

<i>TRAINING A CHILD’S APPETITE.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>What a grown person likes to eat or drink
depends largely on what that person was trained
to eat or drink while a child. And a child can be
trained to like almost any sort of food or drink,
either good or bad. No small responsibility, therefore,
for both the health and the enjoyment of a
child, devolves on him who has in hand the training
of a child’s appetite.</p>

<p>That a child inherits tastes in the matter of food
and drink cannot be questioned; but this fact does
not forbid the training of a child’s tastes away from
its inborn tendencies; it merely adds an element to
be considered in the training process. A child
born in the tropics soon learns to like the luscious
fruits which are given to him freely; while a child
born in the arctic regions learns with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
rapidity to like the grosser diet of fish and oil
which is his chief supply of food. In one region
the people live mainly on roots and berries; in
another, they devour raw flesh or drink fresh
blood; in yet another, they eat dried locusts or
grasshoppers; in yet another, it is milk or honey
which is their chief means of sustaining life. In
every region the children are easily trained to enjoy
the eating of that which they have to eat; and if a
child is taken at an early age from one region to
another, he quickly adapts himself to his new conditions,
and learns to like that which is given to
him as his means of satisfying hunger. All of
which goes to show that the natural appetite of a
child does not demand one kind of food above
another, to that extent which forbids the training
of a child to enjoy that which he can have and
which he ought to use.</p>

<p>As a rule, very little attention is given to the
training of a child’s appetite. The child is supplied
with that food which is easiest obtained, and which
the child is readiest to take. If the parents give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
little thought to their children’s welfare, they simply
allow their children to share with them at the common
table, without considering whether or not the
food is that which is best suited to the children’s
needs. If the parents are tender-hearted, and lovingly
indulgent toward their children, they are
quite likely to show favor by giving to them those
things which please a child’s palate, or which are
favorites with the parents themselves.</p>

<p>Finding that a child likes sugar, a parent is
tempted to give a bit of sugar to a child who is not
ready to take anything else at its meal-time; even
though that bit of sugar may destroy the child’s
appetite for the hour, or disturb the child’s stomach
for all day. Again, seeing that the child is glad to
try any article of food which his parent enjoys, the
parent, perhaps, proffers from his own plate that
which he deems a delicacy; although it may be of
all things the least suited to the child’s state of
health, or condition of being. And so it is that the
child is trained in wrong ways of eating, at the very
time when he most needs training in the right way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>A child is quite likely to have his freaks and
fancies of appetite, which a kind parent is tempted
to indulge instead of checking. One child would
eat only the softer part of bread, while rejecting its
crust. One would eat meat without vegetables;
another would refuse one kind of meat, or of vegetables,
while eating all others freely; and so on.
The more these peculiarities are indulged, the
stronger becomes their hold on the child. The
more they are checked and restrained, the weaker
their power becomes. Yet most parents seem to
count such peculiarities as beyond their control,
and therefore to be accepted as inevitable; instead
of realizing their personal responsibility for the
continuance or the removal of them.</p>

<p>“Your boy ought to eat less meat and more
farinaceous food,” says a physician to a mother,
whose boy is in the doctor’s hands. “Let him
have oatmeal and milk for breakfast; and see to it
that he eats meat only once a day, and sparingly at
that.” “Johnny is a great hand for meat,” is the
answer; “and he can’t take oatmeal.” And in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
answer the mother shows that all the blame in the
case rests on herself, and not on her Johnny.
Johnny ought to have been trained to eat what is
good for him, instead of indulging his personal
whims in the eating line.</p>

<p>When a mother says, “My boy won’t eat potatoes,”
or “He won’t eat tomatoes,” or “He will eat
no meat but beef,” she simply confesses to her culpable
failure of duty in the training of her boy’s
appetite. If she were to say that she did not
approve of one of those things, or of the other,
and therefore she would not give it to him, that
would be one thing; but when she says that he
will not take it even though she thinks it best for
him, that is quite another thing; and there is
where the blame comes in.</p>

<p>Of course, it is to be understood that there are
articles of food in familiar use which, here and
there, a child cannot eat with safety. On the seashore,
for example, the clam, which is eaten freely
by most persons, seems to be as poison to certain
individuals. It is not that these persons do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
like the clam; but it is that their systems recoil
from it, and that its eating is sure to bring on a
serious illness. A like state of things exists with
regard to fresh strawberries in the country. They
are a delicious fruit in the estimation of most persons.
They are as a mild form of poison to certain
individuals. But these cases are abnormal ones.
They have no practical bearing on the prevailing
rule, that a child can be trained to like whatever he
ought to eat, and to refrain from the eating of
whatever is not best for him. And herein is the
principle of wise training in the realm of a child’s
appetite.</p>

<p>A prominent American educator put this principle
into practice in his own family, consisting of
four boys and four girls. He was a man of limited
means, and he felt the necessity of training his
children to eat such food as he deemed proper for
them, and as good as he could afford to supply.
His choice of food for his family table was wisely
made, to begin with; and then he showed wisdom
in his mode of pressing it upon his children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>If those children deemed a dish distasteful, they
were privileged to wait until they were willing to
eat it. There was no undue pressure brought to
bear on them. They could simply eat it, or let it
alone. If they went without it that meal, the same
dish, or a similar one, was before them for the next
meal; and so on until hunger gave them the zest
to eat it with unfeigned heartiness. By this means
those children learned to eat what they ought to
eat; and when they had come to years of maturity
they realized the value of this training, which had
made them the rulers of their appetite, instead of
being its slaves. It needs no single example to
illustrate the opposite course from this one. On
every side we see persons who are subject to the
whims and caprices of their appetite, because their
appetite was never trained to be subject to them.
And in one or another of these two directions the
upbringing of every child is tending to-day.</p>

<p>Peculiarly in the use of candy and of condiments
is a child’s appetite likely to be untrained, or trained
amiss. Neither the one nor the other of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
articles is suited to a child’s needs; but both of
them are allowed to a child, regardless of what is
best for him. The candy is given because the
child fancies it. The condiments are given because
the parents fancy them. Neither of the two is supposed
to be beneficial to the child, but each is given
in its turn because of the child’s wish for it, and
of the parent’s weakness. There <i>are</i> parents who
train their children not to eat candy between meals,
nor to use condiments at meals. These parents
are wiser than the average; and their children are
both healthier and happier. There ought to be
more of such parents, and more of such children.
The difficulty in the way is always with the parents,
instead of with the children.</p>

<p>It is affirmed as a fact, that some Shetland ponies
which were brought to America had been accustomed
to eat fish, and that for a time they refused
to eat hay, but finally were trained to its eating
until they seemed to enjoy it as heartily as other
ponies. Children to whom cod-liver oil was most
distasteful when it was first given to them as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
medicine, have been trained to like cod-liver oil as
well as they liked syrup. And so it has been in
the use of acid drinks, or of bitter coffee, by young
children under the direction of a physician. By
firm and persistent training the children have been
brought to like that from which for a time they
recoiled. It is for the parents to decide, with the
help of good medical counsel, what their children
ought to like, and then to train them to like it.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy matter for a parent to
train a child’s appetite; but it is a very important
matter, nevertheless. Nothing that is worth doing
in this world is an easy matter; and whatever is
really worth doing is worth all that its doing costs—and
more. In spite of all its difficulties, the
training of any child’s appetite can be compassed,
by God’s blessing. And compassed it ought to be,
whatever are its difficulties. It is for the parent to
decide what the child shall eat, as it is for the
parent to decide what that child shall wear. The
parent who holds himself responsible for what a
child shall put on, but who shirks his responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
for what that child shall take in, would seem to
have more regard for the child’s appearance than
for his upbuilding from within; and that could
hardly be counted a sign of parental wisdom or of
parental love.</p>

<i>TRAINING A CHILD AS A
QUESTIONER.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A child is a born questioner. He does not have
to be trained to be a questioner; but he does need
to be trained as a questioner. A child has been
not inaptly called “an animated interrogation-point.”
Before a child can speak his questions,
he looks them; and when he can speak them out,
his questions crowd one another for expression,
until it would seem that, if a parent were to answer
all of his child’s questions, that parent would have
time to do nothing else. The temptation to a
parent, in view of this state of things, is to repress
a child as a questioner, rather than to train him
as a questioner; and just here is where a parent
may lose or undervalue a golden privilege as a
parent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The beginning of all knowledge is a question.
All progress in knowledge is a result of continued
questioning. Whence? What? Why? Wherefore?
Whither? These are the starting-points of
investigation and research to young and to old
alike; and when any one of these questions has
been answered in one sphere, it presents itself anew
in another. Unless a child were a questioner at
the beginning of his life, he could make no start
in knowledge; and if a child were ever caused to
stay his questionings, there would be at once an
end to his progress in knowledge. Questioning is
the expression of mental appetite. He who lacks
the desire to question, is in danger of death from
intellectual starvation.</p>

<p>Yet with all the importance that, on the face of
it, attaches to a child’s impulse to ask questions, it
is unmistakably true that far more pains are taken
by parents generally to check children in their
questionings, than to train them in their questioning.
“Don’t be asking so many questions;”
“Why will you be asking questions all the time?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>”
“You’ll worry my life out with your questions.”
These are the parental comments on a child’s
questions, rather than, “I’m glad to have you
want to know about all these things;” or,
“Never hesitate to ask me a question about anything
that you want to know more of;” or, “The
more questions you ask, the better, if only they
are proper questions.”</p>

<p>Sooner or later the average child comes to feel
that, the fewer questions he asks, the more of a
man he will be; and so he represses his impulse to
inquire into the nature and purpose and meaning
of that which newly interests him; until, perhaps,
he is no longer curious concerning that which he
does not understand, or is hopeless of any satisfaction
being given to him concerning the many problems
which perplex his wondering mind. By the
time he has reached young manhood, he who was
full of questions in order that he might have knowledge,
seems to be willing to live and die in ignorance,
rather than to make a spectacle of himself by
multiplying questions that may be an annoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to others, or that may be deemed a source of discredit
to himself.</p>

<p>There are obvious reasons why the average
parent is not inclined to encourage his child to
ask all the questions he thinks of. In the first
place, it takes a great deal of time to answer a
child’s questions. It takes time to feed a child, and
to wash it and dress it; but it takes still more time
to supply food and clothing for a child’s mind.
And when a parent finds that the answering of
fifty questions in succession from a child only
seems to prompt the child to ask five hundred
questions more, it is hardly to be wondered at that
the parent thinks there ought to be a stop put
to this sort of thing somewhere. Then, again, a
child’s questions are not always easy to be answered
by the child’s parent. The average child can ask
questions that the average parent cannot answer;
and it is not pleasant for a parent to be compelled
to confess ignorance on a subject in which his child
has a living interest. It is so much easier, and so
much more imposing, for a parent to talk to a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
on a subject which the parent does understand, and
which the child does not, than it is for the parent
to be questioned by the child on a subject which
neither child nor parent understands, that the
parent’s temptation is a strong one to discountenance
a habit that has this dangerous tendency.</p>

<p>That there ought to be limitations to a child’s
privilege of question-asking is evident; for every
privilege, like every duty, has its limitations. But
the limitations of this privilege ought to be as
to the time when questions may be asked, and as
to the persons of whom they may be asked, rather
than as to the extent of the questioning. A child
ought not to be free to ask his mother’s guest how
old she is, or why she does not look as pleasant as
his mother; nor yet to ask one of his poorer playmates
why he has no better shoes, or how it is that
his mother has to do her own washing. A child
must not interrupt others in order to ask a question
that fills his mind, nor is it always right for him
to ask a question of his father or mother before
others. When to ask, and of whom to ask, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
questions that it is proper for him to ask, must be
made known to a child in connection with his
training by his parents as a questioner.</p>

<p>It is to the parent that a child ought to be privileged
to come in unrestrained freeness as a questioner.
Both the mother and the father should
welcome from a child any question that the child
honestly desires an answer to. And every parent
ought to set apart times for a child’s free questioning,
when the child can feel that the hour is as
sacred to that purpose as the hour of morning and
evening devotion is sacred to prayer. It may be
just before breakfast, or just after, or at the close
of the day, that the father is to be always ready to
answer his child’s special questions. It may be
when father and child walk out together, or during
the quieter hours of Sunday, that the child is
sure of his time for questioning his father. The
mother’s surest time for helping her child as a
questioner, is at the child’s bed-time; although
her child may be free to sit by her side when she
is sewing, or to stand near her when she is busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
about other household matters, and to question
her while she is thus working. Whenever the
child’s hour for questioning his parent has come,
the child ought to be encouraged to ask any and
every question that he really wants to ask; and
the parent ought to feel bound to give to the
child’s every question a loving and well-considered
answer.</p>

<p>A child needs parental help in his training as a
questioner. While he is to be free to ask questions,
he is to exercise his freedom within the
limits of reason and of a right purpose. A
child may be inclined to multiply silly questions,
thoughtless questions, aimless questions. In such
a case, he needs to be reminded of his duty of
seeking knowledge and of trying to gain it, and
that neither his time nor his parent’s time ought
to be wasted in attending to questions that have
no point to them. Again, a child may be inclined
to dwell unduly on a single point in his questioning.
Then it is his parent’s duty to turn him away
from that point by inducing him to question on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
another point. Whenever a child is questioning
his parent, that parent has the responsibility and
the power of training the child as a questioner,
by receiving in kindness and by shaping with
discretion the child’s commendable impulse and
purpose of questioning.</p>

<p>When a child asks a question that a parent really
cannot answer, it is a great deal better for the parent
to say frankly, “I do not know,” than to say impatiently,
“Oh! don’t be asking such foolish questions.”
But, on the other hand, it is often better to
give a simple answer, an answer to one point in the
child’s question, than to attempt an answer that is
beyond the child’s comprehension, or than to say
that it is impossible to explain that subject to a
child just now. For example, if a child asks why
it is that the sunrise is always to be seen from the
windows on one side of the house, and the sunset
from the windows on the other side, there is no
need of telling him that he is too young to have
that explained to him, nor yet of attempting an explanation
of the astronomical facts involved. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
better way is to answer him that the one window
looks toward the east and the other toward the
west; and that the sun rises in the east and sets
in the west. This will give the child one new item
of knowledge; and that is all that he cares for
just then.</p>

<p>A child may ask a question on a point that cannot
with propriety be made clear to him just yet.
In such a case he ought not to be rebuked for
seeking light, but an answer of some kind is to be
given to him, in declaration of a general truth that
includes the specific subject of his inquiry; and
then he is to be kindly told that by and by he can
know more about this than he can now. This
will satisfy a well-disposed child for the time being,
while it will encourage him to continue in the attitude
of a truth-seeking questioner.</p>

<p>A very simple answer to his every question is
all that a child looks for; but that is his right,
if he is honestly seeking information, and it is his
parent’s duty to give it to him, if he comes for it
at a proper time and in a proper spirit. A child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is harmed if he be unduly checked as a questioner;
and he is helped as he could be in no
other way, as a truth-seeker, if he be encouraged
and wisely trained by his parents in a child’s high
prerogative as a questioner.</p>

<i>TRAINING A CHILD’S FAITH.</i></h2></div>


<p>There is no need of trying to implant faith in a
child’s nature, for it is there to begin with. But
there is need of training a child’s faith, so that it
shall be rightly directed and wisely developed.
Every child has the instinct of faith, as surely
as it has the instinct of appetite. The inborn
impulse to seek nourishment is not more real and
positive in a normal child, than is the impulse
in such a child to cling to and to trust another.
Both instincts are already there, and both need
training.</p>

<p>The faith here spoken of is that faith that rests
on a person, not that miscalled “faith” which
applies to an assent to a series of dogmas. True
faith, indeed, always rests on a person. Any other
use of the term is only by accommodation, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
liable to be misleading. One of the best definitions
of Christian faith is, “That act by which one person,
a sinner, commits himself to another person, a
Saviour.” Even before a child is old enough to
learn of a Saviour, the instinct of faith is one of the
child’s qualities; just as the instinct of hunger is a
child’s quality before the child is old enough to
know the nature of its fitting food. If a mother,
or a nurse, or even a stranger, puts a finger into
the chubby hand of an infant, that little hand will
close over the proffered finger, and cling to it as
for dear life. And it is not until a child has learned
to distrust, that it is said to be “old enough to be
afraid.” While a child’s faith is yet undisturbed,
as also after a child’s faith has become discriminating,
a child’s faith needs wise directing and developing;
and to this end there is need of wisdom and
of care on the part of those who have the responsibility
of this training.</p>

<p>While the instinct of faith is innate in the child,
a knowledge of the One on whom his faith can rest
with ultimate confidence is not innate. A knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>edge
of God comes to man by revelation; and
whoever has responsibility for a child’s moral training,
has the duty of revealing to that child a
knowledge of God. But a child can understand
God, and can grasp a true conception of him, quite
as easily as the profoundest philosopher can. A
child does not need to be led by degrees into a
knowledge of God. As soon as he is capable of
learning that his voice can be heard by his loving
mother or his loving father in another room, he is
capable of learning that his voice can be heard by
a loving Father whom he has never seen; who is
always within hearing, but never within sight; who
is the loving Father of his father and mother, as
well as of himself and of everybody else; who is
able to do all things, and who is sure to do all
things well. In the knowledge of this truth, a
child can be taught to pray to God in faith, as
early as he can speak; and even to know something
of the meaning of prayer before he can utter
words intelligently.</p>

<p>From the very beginning the child can take in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the great truths concerning God’s nature, and the
scope of God’s power, as fully as a theologian
can take them in. Therefore there need be no
fear that too much is proffered to the child’s mind
in this sphere, if only it all be proffered in simplicity
as explicit truth, without any attempt at its
explanation.</p>

<p>Bishop Patteson, in his missionary work among
the South Sea Islanders, found it best to begin with
John’s Gospel, in imparting religious instruction to
untutored natives; for they could take that in easier
than they could comprehend the historical books
of the Bible. It is much the same with children.
They can receive the profoundest truths of the
Bible without any explanation. When they are
older, they will be better fitted to grapple with
the difficulties of elementary religious teachings.
The idea that a child must have a knowledge of
the outline of the Bible story before he knows
the central truth that Jesus Christ is his loving
Saviour, is as unreasonable as it would be to suppose
that a child must know the anatomy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
human frame before he is able to believe in his
mother’s love for him.</p>

<p>The first lesson in the training of a child’s faith
is the lesson that he is to have faith in God. Many
a child is told to have faith in the power of
prayer, or faith in the value of good conduct, without
being shown that his faith should rest wholly
and absolutely on God. He is told that he can
hope to have whatever he prays for; and that if
he is a good boy he can expect a blessing, while if
he is a bad boy he cannot expect to be blessed.
With this training the child’s faith is drawn away
from God, and is led to rest on his personal conduct;
whereas his faith ought to be trained to rest
on the God to whom he prays, and in loving obedience
to whom he strives to be good.</p>

<p>If you tell a child that God is able and ready to
give him everything that he prays for, the child is
prompt to accept your statement as a truth, and so
he prays for a pleasant day, when a pleasant day is
desired by him. If the pleasant day comes accordingly,
the child’s faith in prayer is confirmed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
if the day be a stormy one, the child’s mind is bewildered,
and a doubt is likely to creep into his
mind whether prayer is always so effective as he
had been told to believe it to be. And the case
is similar when the child prays for the health
of one whom he loves, or for some gift which he
longs to receive, or for success in some personal
endeavor, and the issue is not in accordance with
his petition.</p>

<p>If, however, on the other hand, you plainly tell a
child that God knows what is best for us better than
we know for ourselves, and that, while God is glad
to have us come to him with all our wishes and all
our troubles, we must leave it to God to decide just
what he will give to us and do for us, the child is
ready to accept this statement as the truth; and
then his faith in God is not disturbed in the slightest
degree by finding that God has decided to do
differently from his request to God in prayer. On
every side, children are being taught to have faith
in prayer, rather than to have faith in God; and, in
consequence, their faith is continually subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
shocks which would never have disturbed it if it
had been trained to rest on God instead of resting
on prayer.</p>

<p>If you tell a child that God loves good children,
and that he does not love bad children, the child
will believe you; and then, when he thinks he is a
good child, he will be glad that there is a God who
can appreciate him; but when he knows he is a
bad child, he will perhaps be sorry that there is a
God in the universe to be his enemy. So far as
your training does its legitimate work, in this instance,
the child is trained, not to have faith in
God, but to have confidence in his own merits as a
means of commending him to the God whom you
have misrepresented to him. If, on the other
hand, you tell a child that God is love, and that his
love goes out unfailingly toward all, even toward
those who have no love for him, and that,
while God loves to have children good, he loves
them tenderly while they are very bad, the
child will take in that great truth gratefully; and
then he is readier to have faith in God, and to want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to be good because the loving God loves to have
him good. And in this way a child’s faith in God
may be the means of quickening and shaping his
desires in the direction of well-doing.</p>

<p>As a means of training a child’s faith in God
more intelligently and with greater definiteness, the
fact of the Incarnation may be disclosed to him in
all the fulness of its richest meaning. A very
young child can comprehend the truth that God in
his love sent his Son into this world as a little child,
with the name Jesus—or Saviour; that Jesus grew
up from childhood into manhood, that he loved little
children, that he died for them, that he rose again
from the dead, and ascended into heaven, that still he
loves children, that he watches over them tenderly,
and that he is ready to help them in all their trials
and needs, and to be their Saviour forever. With
this knowledge of Jesus as God’s representative, a
child can be trained to trust Jesus at all times; to
feel safe in darkness and in danger because of his
nearness, his love, and his power; to be sure of his
sympathy, and to rest on him as a sufficient Sav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>iour.
That a child is capable of such faith as this,
is not fairly a question. The only question, if
question there be, is whether any one but a child
can attain to such faith. One thing is as sure as
the words of Jesus are true, and that is, that “whosoever
shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
little child shall in no wise enter therein;” or, in
other words, that a little child’s faith is a pattern
for the believers of every age.</p>

<p>The training of a child’s faith is the most delicate
and the most important duty that devolves upon
one who is set to the work of child-training. More
is involved in it for the child’s welfare, and more
depends upon it for the child’s enjoyment and efficiency
in life, than pivots on any other phase of the
training of a child. He who would train a child’s
faith aright has need of wisdom, and yet more has
need of faith,—just such faith as that to the exercise
of which he would train the child of his
charge. Peculiarly has a parent need to watch lest
he check or hinder unduly the loving promptings
of a child’s faith; for it is our Lord himself who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
said: “Whoso shall cause one of these little ones
which believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for
him that a great millstone should be hanged about
his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth
of the sea.”</p>

<i>TRAINING CHILDREN TO SABBATH
OBSERVANCE.</i></h2></div>


<p>Every day in the week is the Lord’s day, for
children; but one day in the week is peculiarly
the Lord’s day, for children as well as for older
persons. How to train a child to wise and faithful
Sabbath observance, on the Lord’s day, is a question
that puzzles many a Christian parent; and,
as a rule, the more true and loving and Christ-like
the parent, the greater the practical puzzle at this
point. The difficulty in the case is not so much,
how to secure the observance of the Sabbath by a
child, as it is to decide what should be the proper
observance of the Sabbath by a child.</p>

<p>If, indeed, it were simply a question of compelling
a child to conform to certain fixed and
rigid rules of Sabbath observance, any able-bodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and determined parent, with a stern face, and the
help of a birch rod and a dark closet, could compass
all the difficulties of the case. But while it is
a question of bringing the child to enjoy the loving
service of God on God’s peculiar day, it requires
other qualities than sternness on the parent’s part,
and other agencies than a birch rod and a dark
closet, to meet the requirements of the situation.
And so it is that a right apprehension of the nature
of a wise and proper observance of the Sabbath is
an essential prerequisite of the wise and proper
training of children to such an observance.</p>

<p>Love must be at the basis of all acceptable service
of God. Any observance of the commands
of God which is slavish and reluctant, is sure to
lack God’s approval. The Sabbath is a sign, or a
token, of the loving covenant between God and
his people. It is to be borne in mind, it is to be
remembered, it is to be counted holy, accordingly.
One day in seven is to be given up to loving
thoughts of God, to a loving rest from one’s own
work and pleasure, and to a loving part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
worship of God. On that day, above other days,
the thought of God’s children should be:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“This is the day which the Lord hath made;</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;We will rejoice and be glad in it.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How to train children to a joyous observance of
the Lord’s day, to a joyous looking forward to its
coming, and to a joyous looking back upon its
memories, is a weightier question, with thoughtful
and intelligent Christian parents, than how to conform
the conduct of children to the traditional
ideas of legitimate Sabbath observance. An utter
disregard of the Sabbath in the training of children
is a great wrong; but even a greater wrong
than this is the training of children to count the
Lord’s day a day of irksome constraint instead of
a delight.</p>

<p>As a child’s occupation on other days of the
week is different from the occupation of his
parents, so a child’s occupation on the Lord’s day
ought to be different from his parents’ occupation
on that day. It would be cruel, indeed, to insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that on the Lord’s day alone a child should be
forced to do the same things that his parents do,
and that so that day above all others should be a
day of toil and of discomfort to a child. For
parent and for child alike, the Lord’s day should
be a day of rest and of worship; but neither for
parent nor for child is simple inaction rest; nor is
hard Bible-study, or merely sitting still in church-time,
worship. Rest is to be secured by a change
of occupation, and worship is to be performed by
turning the thoughts God-ward. How to help children
to refreshing rest and to joyous worship on
the Lord’s day, is the practical matter at issue.</p>

<p>To bring a child into habits of loving and reverent
Sabbath observance is a matter of training;
and that training ought to begin at a very early
age of the child, and continue throughout the
years of his childhood. Long before a child can
know what is the distinctive idea of the Sabbath,
or why it is to be observed in a manner peculiar
to itself, he can be trained to perceive that one day
in seven is different from the other six days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that its standard is higher and its spirit more joyous;
that its tone is quieter, and its atmosphere
more reverent. And all this ought to be secured
to every child in a Christian home, from the very
outset of the child’s training to its close. Even a
dog, or a horse, or an ox, learns to know and to
prize some of the privileges and enjoyments of the
Sabbath; and an infant in arms is as capable as
one of the brutes of receiving an impression of
truth in this realm of fact and sentiment. But
in the case of the infant or of the brute everything
depends upon those persons who have it
in training.</p>

<p>A common cause of trouble in this matter is,
that the training does not begin early enough. A
child is permitted to go on for months, if not for
years, without any direct suggestion of a difference
between the Lord’s day and other days of the
week; and when the first attempt is made to show
him that such a difference ought to be recognized,
he is already fixed in habits which stand in the
way of this recognition, so that the new call on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
him breaks in unpleasantly upon his course of
favorite infantile action. Yet it ought to be so
that a child’s earliest consciousness of life is linked
with the evidences of the greater light and joy
and peace of the day that is above other days of
the week, in his nursery experiences, and that his
earliest habits are in the line of such a distinction
as this. And thus it can be.</p>

<p>It is for the parents to make clear the distinction
that marks, in the child’s mind, the Lord’s day as
the day of days in the week’s history. The child
may be differently dressed, or differently washed,
or differently handled, on that day from any other.
Some more disagreeable detail of his morning
toilet, or of his day’s management, might on that
day be omitted, as a means of marking the day.
There may be a sweeter song sung in his hearing,
or a brighter exhibit of some kind made in his
sight, or a peculiar favor of some sort granted to
him, which links a special joy with that day in
comparison with the days on either side of it. As
soon as the child is old enough to grasp a rattle or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to play with a toy, there ought to be a difference
between his Sabbath rattle or other toy, and his
week-day delights in the same line. By one means
or another he should have the Lord’s day to look
back upon as his brightest memory, and to look
forward to as his fondest anticipation. And in this
way he can be trained to enjoy the Lord’s day,
even before he can know why it is made a joy to
him. A child is well started in the line of wise
training when he is carried along as far as this.</p>

<p>When the anniversary of a child’s birthday comes
around, a loving parent is likely to emphasize and
illustrate to the child the parental love which should
make that season a season of gladness and joy to
the child. Special gifts or special favors are bestowed
on the child at such a time, so that the
child shall be sure to welcome each successive return
of his birthday anniversary. So, again, when
the Christmas anniversary has come, the Christian
parent sees to it that the child has a cause of delight
in the enjoyments and possessions it brings.
It is not that the parents are lacking in love at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
other times; but it is that the child shall have fresh
reminders, at these anniversary seasons, of that love
which is unfailing throughout the year. So it
ought to be, in the effort to make clear and prominent,
on the return of each Lord’s day, the love of
God which is the same at one time as at another.
As the parents will treasure little gifts as loving
surprises for their children on the birthday and the
Christmas anniversary, so the parents ought to plan
to make each new Lord’s day a better, brighter day
than any other of the week; and to this end the
best things for the child’s enjoyment may well be
kept back until then, as a help to this uplifting of
the delights of the day above the week-days’
highest level.</p>

<p>It is customary to keep a child’s best clothing
for use on the Lord’s day. It might well, also, be
customary to keep a child’s best toys, best pictures,
best books, best enjoyments, for a place in the same
day of days in the week’s round. This is a custom
in many a well-ordered Christian home, and the
advantages of it are apparent there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sabbath closet, or Sabbath cabinet, or Sabbath
drawer, ought to be a treasure-house of delights
in every Christian home; not to be opened
except on the Lord’s day, and sure to bring added
enjoyment when it is opened in the children’s
sight. In that treasure-house there may be bright
colored pictures of Bible scenes; Sunday-school
papers; books of stories which are suitable and
attractive above others for Sabbath reading; dissected
maps of Bible lands, or dissected pages of
Bible texts, of the Lord’s Prayer, or of the Apostles’
Creed; models of the Tabernacle, or of Noah’s
Ark and its inmates. Whatever is there, ought
resolutely to be kept there at all other times than
on the Lord’s day. However much the children
may long for the contents of that treasure-house,
between Sabbaths, they ought to find it impossible
to have a view of them until that day of days has
come round again. The use of these things should
be associated inseparably, in the children’s minds,
with the Lord’s day and its privileges, and so
should help to make that day a delight, as a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of God’s choicest gifts to those whom God loves
and who love him. By such means the very plays
or recreations of the children may be made as
truly a means of rest and of worship on the children’s
part as are the labors of the parents, in the
line of Bible study or of Sunday-school teaching,
a means of Sabbath rest and of Sabbath worship
to <i>them</i> on each recurring Lord’s day.</p>

<p>Even for the youngest children there may be a
touch of Sabbath enjoyment in a piece of Sabbath
confectionery, or of Sabbath cake, of a sort allowed
them at no other time. There are little ones who
are not permitted to have candy freely at their own
homes, but who are privileged to have a choice bit
of this at their grandmother’s, where they visit,
after Sunday-school, on every Lord’s day. And
there are grown-up children who remember pleasantly
that when they were very little ones they
were permitted to have a make-believe Sabbath
visit together in their happy home, with a table
spread with tiny dishes of an attractive appearance,
which they never saw except on the Lord’s day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
There are others who remember with what delight
they were accustomed, while children, after a certain
age, to sit up and have a place at the family table
at tea-time, on Sundays; although on other days
they must be in bed before that hour.</p>

<p>If, indeed, the Lord’s day is, in any such way,
made a day of peculiar delight to children, with
the understanding on their part—as they come to
years of understanding—that this is because the
day is peculiarly the Lord’s day, there is a gain to
them, so far, in the Lord’s plan of the Sabbath for
man’s welfare in the loving service of the loving
God. But if, on the other hand, the first impressions
in the children’s mind concerning this day of
days are, that it is a day of harsh prohibitions and
of dreariness and discomfort, there is so far a dishonoring
in their minds of the day and of Him
whose day it is; and for this result their unwise
parents are, of course, responsible.</p>

<p>As children grow older, and are capable of comprehending
more fully the spiritual meanings and
privileges and possibilities of the Sabbath, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
need more help from their parents,—not less help,
but more,—in order to their wise use of the day,
and to the gaining of its greatest advantages. The
hour of family worship ought to have more in it
on the Lord’s day than on any other day of the
week. Its exercises should be ampler and more
varied. Either at that hour, or at some other, the
Sunday-school lesson for the week should be taken
up and studied by parents and children together.</p>

<p>There are homes where the children have a Sunday-school
of their own, at a convenient hour of
the day, in the family room, led by father or mother,
or by older brother or sister, with the help of maps
and blackboard, or slates. There are other homes
in which the father leads a children’s service of
worship, in the early evening, and reads a little
sermon from some one of the many published
volumes of sermons for children. Wherever either
of these plans is adopted, there should be a part
for each of the children, not only in the singing
and reading, but in asking and answering
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from such formal exercises as these, one
child can be showing and explaining a book of
Bible pictures or of Scripture cards to younger
children; or one group of children can be picking
out Bible places or Bible persons from their
recent lessons and arranging them alphabetically
on slates or on slips of paper, while another group
is studying out some of the many Bible puzzles
or curious Bible questions which are published so
freely for such a purpose. Variety in methods
is desirable from week to week, and variety is
practicable.</p>

<p>The singing of fitting and attractive songs of joy
and praise will naturally have larger prominence,
at the hours of family worship, and at other hours
of the day and evening, on the Lord’s day, than
on other days of the week. And parents ought
to find time on the Lord’s day to read aloud to
their children, or to tell them, stories suited to
their needs, as well as to lead in familiar conversation
with them. For <i>this</i> mode of training there
can be no satisfactory substitute. Of course, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
takes time, and it calls for courage, for high
resolve, or self-denial, and for faith. But it is
worth more than all it costs.</p>

<p>All this is apart from the question of the attendance
and duties of the little ones at the Sunday-school
or at the place of public worship. When a
child is of suitable age to have an intelligent part
in the exercises of the Sunday-school, he should
be helped to find those exercises a means of sacred
enjoyment. When, at a later day, he is old enough
to be at the general service of worship without
undue weariness, it is the duty of the parents to
make that place a place of gladsomeness to him,
as often as he is found there. Not wearisomeness,
but rest, is appropriate to the holiest Sabbath
services of the Lord’s day. Not deepened
shadow, but clearer sunlight, is fitting to its
sacred hours.</p>

<p>The spirit of the entire day’s observances ought
to be a reverent spirit; but it should be understood
by the parents that true reverence is better
shown in gladness than in gloom. Where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Lord’s day is counted a dismal one by the children,
it is obvious that the parents have failed to
train their children to hallow that day, as the day
which is peculiarly sacred to the love of their loving
Father in heaven. Whether at home, or at
Sunday-school or any other church service, the
children should be helped to realize that the day
is a day of brightness and of cheer; that while
differing in its occupations and enjoyments from
all other days, it is the best of them all. When a
little boy, out of a home thus ordered, heard one
of his companions express, on Sunday, a wish that
it was already Monday, the little fellow said, with
evident heartiness, “Why! don’t <i>you</i> like Sunday?
I like it best of all the days.” And so it
ought to be in the case of every boy and girl in a
Christian home.</p>

<p>The difference is not in the children, but in the
mode of their training, when in one home the
Sabbath is welcomed and in another home it is
dreaded by the little ones. Such a difference
ought not to exist. By one means or another, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
by one means and another, all children ought to
be trained to find the Lord’s day a day of delight
in the Lord’s service; and parents ought to see to
it that <i>their</i> children, if not others, are thus trained.
It can be so; it should be so.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>XVI.<br /><br />

<i>TRAINING A CHILD IN AMUSEMENTS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Amusements properly belong to children. A
child needs to be amused while he is a child, and
because he is a child. It may be a question
whether a grown-up person, of average intelligence
and of tolerable moral worth, does really need
amusements, however much he may need diversion
or recreation within due limits; but there can be no
fair question as to the need of amusements for a
child. And if a child has need of amusements, he
has need to be trained in his choice and use of
amusements.</p>

<p>How to amuse a child wisely and with effectiveness,
is a practical question with a nurse or loving
parent, from the time that the little babe first begins
to look up with interest at a ball or a trinket swung
before his eyes just out of reach of his uplifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hands, or to look and listen as a toy rattle is shaken
above him,—all the way along until he is old
enough to choose his own methods of diversion
and recreation. And on the answering of this
question much depends for the child’s character
and happiness; for amusements have their influence
in shaping a child’s estimates of life and its purposes,
and in fitting or unfitting him for the duties
he has to perform in life.</p>

<p>There is a wide range in a child’s amusements;
in their nature, in their tendency, and in the companionships
which accompany them. The differences
between some of these which may seem but
slight at the start, involve differences of principle
as well as of method; and they need to be looked
at in view of their probable outcome, rather than
as they present themselves just now to the surface
observer. Indeed, it is the looking for the underlying
principle in the attractiveness of a given form
of amusement, and for the obvious trend of its
influence, that is the primary duty of a parent who
would train his children wisely in their amusements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
from the earliest beginning of effort to amuse those
children.</p>

<p>The center of companionships in a child’s amusements
ought to be the parents themselves. In the
nature of things it is impossible for the parents to
be a child’s only companions in this line, or to be
always his companions; but parents ought, in some
way and at some time, to evidence such an interest
in their every child’s amusements that he will feel
that he is as close to his parents, and that his
parents are as much to him, in this thing as in any
other. If, indeed, a child had no companionship
with his parents in his amusements, there would be
reared a sad barrier between him and his parents in
that sphere of his life which is largest and most
attractive while he is at an age to be most impressible.</p>

<p>“One of the first duties of a genuinely Christian
parent,” says Bushnell, “is to show a generous
sympathy with the plays of his children; providing
playthings and means of play, inviting suitable
companions for them, and requiring them to have
it as one of their pleasures, to keep such compan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ions
entertained in their plays, instead of playing
always for their own mere self-pleasing. Sometimes,
too, the parent having a hearty interest in
the plays of his children, will drop out for the time
the sense of his years, and go into the frolic of their
mood with them. They will enjoy no other time
so much as that, and it will have the effect to make
the authority, so far unbent, just as much stronger
and more welcome, as it has brought itself closer
to them, and given them a more complete show of
sympathy.”</p>

<p>A true mother will naturally incline to show a
hearty interest in her child’s amusements, and she
ought to encourage herself to feel that the time
taken for this exhibit of her loving sympathy with
him is by no means lost time. It may be harder
for the father, than for the mother, to give the time
or to show the interest essential to this duty; but
he ought to secure the benefit of it in some way.
A few minutes given to the little ones, as they are
privileged to clamber into the father’s bed before
he is up in the morning, and romp with them there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
will do much to connect him pleasantly with their
play-time. So, again, will a brief season at the
close of the day, when he becomes acquainted with
their special amusements, and shows that they are
much to him, because they are much to his dear ones.</p>

<p>No companionship should be permitted to a child
in his amusements that is likely to lower his moral
tone, or to vitiate his moral taste. There are cases
in which a parent is tempted to allow his children
to be taken into a portion of the home establishment,
or of the immediate neighborhood, in order
that they may be amused by or with the children
or the grown persons there, when he would be unwilling
to have them under such influences or in
such surroundings for any other purpose. This
is a great mistake. The companionships of a child
in the stable or at the street corner, while he is
merely being amused, are likely to be quite as
potent and pervasive as those which are around
him in the parlor or the dining-room, at a time
when his nature is not so actively and freely at its
fullest play. In fact, the companionships which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
accompany a child’s amusements are an important
feature in the training forces of this sphere.</p>

<p>Amusements may be, and ought to be, such as
will aid in developing and upbuilding a child’s
manliness or womanliness. Again, they may be
such as will prove an injury to the tastes and character
of the child. Even the simplest forms of
amusement may have in them the one or the other
of these tendencies. A child’s earlier playthings
and games may have much to do with training
his eye and ear and hand and voice and bodily
movements. They ought all to be watched and
shaped accordingly. This truth is the fundamental
one in the kindergarten system; and a study of
the methods of that system may be of service to
a parent who would learn how to guide a child in
his amusements in this direction.</p>

<p>Peculiarly is it important that a child’s amusements
should not have in them any element of
<i>chance</i>, as tending to give him the idea that his
attainments or progress in life will depend in any
measure upon “luck.” From his play with build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ing-blocks
or with jack-straws, up to his games of
ball or of chess, every movement that a child is
called on to make in the sphere of his amusements
ought to be one in which his success or his failure
is dependent on his skill or his lack of it. A child
may be harmed for life by the conviction that his
hope of success in the world rests on that “streak
of luck” which seemed to be his in the games of
chance he played in boyhood. And a child may
be helped for life by the character which was developed
in him in his boyhood’s games of skill.
It was an illustration of this principle, when the
Duke of Wellington pointed to the playground of
Eton, and said, “It was there that the battle of
Waterloo was won.”</p>

<p>Children’s amusements should be such as do not
of themselves involve late hours, or tend directly
to the premature developing of their young natures.
They should not be such as are likely to
become permanent occupations rather than temporary
amusements; such as gain a stronger and
stronger hold with the passing years instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
being outgrown with childhood; or such as open
the way to the child’s becoming a professional
amusement-maker. They should be such as will
have a centripetal rather than a centrifugal force, as
related to the home circle.</p>

<p>It ought to be so, in every well-ordered home,
that a child can find more pleasure at home than
away from home; and this state of things will depend
very much upon the kind of amusements that
are secured in a child’s home. It is not enough
that there be amusements at the home, but the
amusements there must be those that cannot be
engaged in elsewhere as well as there. Many a
parent makes the mistake of trying to keep his
children at home by introducing amusements there
that arouse in the children a desire to go elsewhere
for something of the same sort in greater freshness
or variety. But wiser parents secure to their children
such home amusements as cannot be indulged
in to the same advantage outside of that home.</p>

<p>A child may have such a “baby-house,” such a
collection of dolls and doll-furniture, such a “play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>closet,”
such a store of building-blocks and mechanical
toys, such a cellar or such a garret, in his
or her own home, as cannot be found in any other
home. To be at home with these will be more
attractive than to be in another home without them.
There may be such an interest excited in scrap-book
making, in picture-painting, in candy-making, with
the advantages for carrying it on, at the child’s
home, that to go away from home would be a loss,
so far, instead of a gain. Singing and music may
be such a feature in the home life that the loss of it
will be felt outside of that home. So it may be
with those social games that involve a measure of
intelligence and information not to be found in
ordinary homes elsewhere. All such amusements
partake of the centripetal rather than the centrifugal
force, as related to the children’s home; and
they have their advantage accordingly. It is for
the parents to secure these for the children, or to
incur the penalty of their lack.</p>

<p>Children will have amusements, whether their
parents choose their amusements for them, or leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the children to choose them for themselves. The
amusements of children will tend to the gain or to
the loss of the children. It is for parents to decide
whether the children shall be left to choose their
own amusements, with the probability of their
choosing to their own harm; or whether the
parents shall choose helpful amusements for their
children, and shall make these amusements more
attractive than the harmful ones. The result of
this choice is an important one to the parents, and
a yet more important one to the children.</p>

<i>TRAINING A CHILD TO COURTESY.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Unless a man is courteous toward others, he is
at a disadvantage in the world, even though he be
the possessor of every other good trait and quality
possible to humanity, and of every material, mental,
and spiritual acquisition which can belong to mere
man. And if a man be marked by exceptional
courtesy in all his intercourse with others, he has
an advantage to start with in the struggle of life,
beyond all that could be his in health and wealth
and wisdom without courtesy. Yet courtesy is
never wholly a natural quality. It is always a
result of training; albeit the training will be far
easier in one case than in another.</p>

<p>Courtesy is the external manifestation of a right
spirit toward others. Its basis is in an unselfish
and a fitting regard for the rights and feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
those with whom one is brought into intercourse;
but the principles of its expression must be a matter
of wise study on the part of those who have
had experience in the ways of the world, and who
would give the benefit of their experience to those
who come after them. Courtesy is not merely a
surface finish of manners; although courtesy is
sure to show itself in a finished surface of manners.
Good breeding, politeness, and fine manners, are all
included in the term “courtesy;” but these all are
the expression of courtesy, rather than its essence
and inspiration. “Good breeding,” says one, “is
made up of a multitude of petty sacrifices.” “True
politeness,” says another, “is the spirit of benevolence
showing itself in a refined way. It is the
expression of good-will and kindness.” Fine manners,
De Quincey says, consist “in two capital
features: first of all, respect of others; secondly,
in self-respect.”</p>

<p>The courteous man is sure not to be lacking in
self-respect, but he is sure to be lacking in self-assertion.
His self-respect is shown in his sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of a responsibility for the comfort and welfare of
others; and his unselfish interest in others causes
him to lose all thought of himself in his effort to
discharge his responsibility toward others. His
courtesy will be evidenced in what he is ready to
do for others, rather than in what he seems to look
for from others.</p>

<p>Attractiveness of personal appearance, gracefulness
in bearing, tastefulness in dress, elegance in
manners, and carefulness in word and tone of voice,
may, indeed, all be found where there is no true
courtesy. The very purpose on the part of their
possessor to be thought courteous, to command
respect, and to appear to advantage, may cause
him or her to show a lack of courtesy, to fail of
commanding respect, and to appear far otherwise
than advantageously. On the other hand, there
are, for example, ladies whose attractions of face
and form are but slight, who care little for dress,
who pay no attention to mere manners, who are
yet so unselfishly thoughtful of others, in all their
intercourse with them, that they are called “just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
delightful” by everybody who knows them. When
they have callers, or when they are making calls,
they have absolutely no thought about themselves,
their appearance, their modes of expression, or the
impression they may make on others. They are
for the time being absolutely given up to those
with whom they converse. They question and
listen with enthusiastic interest; they say kindly
words because they feel kindly; they avoid unpleasant
subjects of mention, and they introduce
topics that cannot but be welcome. Because they
keep self out of sight, they win respect, admiration,
and affection, beyond all that they would dare hope
for. And many a man shows a similar self-forgetfulness
in his courteous interest in others, and
wins a loving recognition of his courtesy on every
side. Real courtesy is, however, impossible, in
either sex, except where self is practically lost
sight of.</p>

<p>In training a child to courtesy, it is of little use
to tell him to be forgetful of himself; but it is of
value to tell him to be thoughtful of others. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
more a person tries to forget himself, the surer he
will be to think of himself. Often, indeed, it is the
very effort of a person to forget himself, that makes
that person painfully self-conscious, and causes him
to seem bashful and embarrassed. But when a
child thinks of others, his thoughts go away from
himself, and self-forgetfulness is a result, rather
than a cause, of his action.</p>

<p>To tell a young person to enter a full room without
any show of embarrassment, or thought of
himself, is to put a barrier in the way of his being
self-possessed through self-forgetfulness. But to
send a young person into a full room with a life-and-death
message to some one already there, is to
cause him to forget himself through filling him
with thought of another. And this distinction in
methods of training is one to be borne in mind in
all endeavors at training children to courtesy.</p>

<p>In order to be courteous, a child must have a
care to give due deference to others, in his ordinary
salutations and greetings, and in his expression of
thanks for every kindness or attention shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
him. So far most parents, who give any thought
to a matter like this, are ready to go. But true
courtesy includes a great deal more than this; and
a child needs training accordingly.</p>

<p>Many a boy who is careful to give a respectful
greeting to his superiors on the street, or in the
house, and who never fails to proffer thanks for any
special favor shown to him, lacks greatly in courtesy
in his ordinary intercourse with others, because
he has not been trained to feel and to show
an unselfish interest in those with whom he is
brought face to face. Such a boy is more ready
to talk of himself, and of that which has a personal
interest to him, than to find out what has an
interest to others, and to make himself interested
in that, or to express his interest in it if he already
feels such an interest. If, indeed, from any reason,
he finds himself unable to talk freely of that which
immediately concerns him, he is often at a loss for
a topic of conversation, and is liable to show awkwardness
and embarrassment in consequence. And
so while courteous at points of conventional eti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>quette,
a boy of this sort is constantly exhibiting
his lack of courtesy.</p>

<p>This liability of a child must be borne in mind
by his parents in his training, and it must be
guarded against by wise counsel and by watchful
inquiry on their part. When a child has a playmate
with him in his home, he must be trained
to make it his first business to find out what that
playmate would enjoy, and to shape his own words
and ways in conformity with that standard, for the
time being. When a child is going into another
home, he must be told in advance of his duty to
be a sharer with those whom he meets there, in
their employments and pleasures, and to express
heartily his sense of enjoyment in that which
pleases them. When he returns from a visit from
another home, he should be asked to tell what he
found of interest there, and what he said about it
while there; and he should be commended or
counseled in proportion to his well-doing or his
lack in his exhibit of courtesy in this connection.
When he has been talking with an older person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in his own home or abroad, his parents ought to
ascertain just how far he has been lacking in
courtesy by putting himself forward unduly, or
how far he has shown courtesy by having and
evidencing an interest in that which was said to
him or done for him by his superior; and kindly
comment on his course should be given to him
by his parents at such a time.</p>

<p>If, indeed, a child has shown any lack of courtesy
toward another, whether a person of his own
age or older, he should be instructed to be frank
and outspoken in expression of his regret for his
course, and of his desire to be forgiven for his
fault. True courtesy involves a readiness to apologize
for any and every failure, whether intentional
or unintentional, to do or say just that which
ought to have been done or said; and the habit
of frank apologizing is acquired by a child only
through his careful training in that direction. He
who has any reluctance to proffer apologies on
even the slightest cause for them, is sadly lacking
in the spirit of courtesy; for just so far as one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
thoughtfully considerate of the feelings of another
will he want to express his regret that any performance
or failure on his part has been a cause of
discomfort to another.</p>

<p>All this is, of course, a trying matter to a child,
and a taxing matter to a parent; but it is to the
obvious advantage of both parties. If a child is
seen to be lacking in courtesy, his parents are
understood to be at fault in his training, so far. If,
on the other hand, a child is not trained to courtesy
while a child, he is at a disadvantage from his lack
of training, as long as he lives. If he has not been
trained to give others the first place in his thoughts
while he is with them, and to give open expression
to all the interest in them which he really has, he
cannot be free and unembarrassed in conversation
with any and all whom he meets. If, on the other
hand, he has had wise and careful training in this
direction, he is sure to be as pleasing as he is courteous
to others; and to receive as much enjoyment
as he gives, through his courtesy in intercourse
with all whom he meets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Personal embarrassment in the presence of
others, and a lack of freedom in the expression
of one’s interest in others, are generally the result
of an undue absorption in one’s own interests or
appearance, and of one’s lack of self-forgetful interest
in the words and ways and needs of those
whom he is summoned to meet. The surest protection
of one’s children against these misfortunes,
is by the wise training of those children to have an
interest in others, and to give expression to that
interest, whenever they are with others, at home or
abroad; and so to be courteous and to show their
courtesy as a result of such training.</p>

<i>CULTIVATING A CHILD’S TASTE
IN READING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>“Reading is to the mind what exercise is to
the body,” says Addison. “As, by the one, health
is preserved, strengthened, and invigorated; by
the other, virtue (which is the health of the mind)
is kept alive, cherished, and confirmed.” And Dr.
Johnson adds, “The foundation of knowledge
must be laid by reading.”</p>

<p>But there is reading, and reading; there is reading
that debilitates and debases the mind; as there
is reading that strengthens and invigorates it.
There is reading that forms the basis of knowledge,
and there is reading that lessens the reader’s
desire for knowledge. A love of reading is an
acquired taste, not an instinctive preference. The
habit of reading is formed in childhood; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
child’s taste in reading is formed in the right direction
or in the wrong one while he is under the
influence of his parents; and <i>they</i> are directly
responsible for the shaping and cultivating of
that taste.</p>

<p>A child ought to read books that are helpful to
his growth in character and in knowledge; and a
child ought to love to read these books. A child
will love to read such books as his parents train,
or permit, him to find pleasure in reading. It is
the parent who settles this question—by action or
by inaction. It is the child who reaps the consequences
of his parents’ fidelity or lack in this
sphere.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not to be understood that a child
is to read, and to love to read, only those books
which add to his stock of knowledge, or which
immediately tend to the improvement of his
morals; for there is as legitimate a place for
amusement and for the lighter play of imagination
in a child’s reading, as there is for recreation
and laughter in the sphere of his physical train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ing.
As one of the fathers of English poetry has
told us,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Books should to one of these four ends conduce,</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;For wisdom, piety, delight, or use;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and that reading which conduces merely to “delight”
for the time being, has its essential part in
the formation of a character that includes wisdom
and piety and useful knowledge. But it is to be
understood that no child should be left to read
only those books to which his untutored tastes
naturally incline him; nor should he be made to
read other books simply as a dry task. His taste
for instructive books as well as for amusing ones
should be so cultivated by the judicious and persistent
endeavors of his parents, that he will find
enjoyment in the one class as truly as in the
other.</p>

<p>“Nonsense songs” and the rhymes of “Mother
Goose” are not to be undervalued, in their place,
as a means of amusement and of attraction in the
direction of a child’s earliest reading. Their mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>sion
in this realm is as real as that of the toy rattle
in the education of a child’s ear, or the dancing-jack
in the training of his eye. But these helps to
amusement are to be looked upon only as aids
toward something better; not as in themselves
sufficient to an end. So, also, it is with the better
class of fairy tales. They meet a want in a child’s
mind in the developing and exercising of his imagination;
and he who has never read them will
inevitably lack something of that incitement and
enjoyment in the realm of fancy which they supply
so liberally. But it is only a beginning of good
work in the sphere of a child’s reading, when he
has found that there is amusement there together
with food for his imagination and fancy. And it is
for the parent to see that the work thus begun does
not stop at its beginning.</p>

<p>There is a place for fiction in the matter of a
child’s reading. Good impressions can be made
on a child’s mind, and his feelings can be swayed
in the direction of the right, by means of a story
that is fictitious without being false. And thus it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
that the average Sunday-school library book has its
mission in the work of child-training. But fiction
ought not to be the chief factor in any child’s reading,
nor can influence and impressions take the
place of instruction and information in the proper
filling of his mind’s treasure-chambers. Even if a
child were to read only the best religious “story-books”
which the world’s literature proffers to
him, this reading by itself would not tend to the
development of his highest mental faculties, or to
the fostering of his truest manhood. Unless he
reads also that which adds to his stock of knowledge,
and which gives him a fresh interest in the
events and personages of the world’s history, a
child cannot obey the Divine injunction to grow
in knowledge as well as in grace, and he will be
the loser by his lack.</p>

<p>That a child is inclined by nature to prefer an
amusing or an exciting story-book to a book of
straightforward fact, everybody knows. But that
is no reason why a child should follow his own
unguided tastes in the matter of reading, any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
than he should be permitted to indulge at all times
his preference, in the realm of appetite, for sweet
cakes instead of bread and butter, or for candies
rather than meat and potatoes. “A child left to
himself causeth shame to his mother,”—and dishonor
to himself, in one sphere of action as in
another; and unless a parent cultivates a taste for
right reading of every sort on a child’s part, that
child can never be at his best in the world, nor can
his parents have such delight in his attainments as
otherwise they might have.</p>

<p>A wise parent can train his children to an interest
in any book in which they ought to be interested.
He can cultivate in their minds such a
taste for books of history, of biography, of travel,
of popular science, and of other useful knowledge,
that they will find in these books a higher and
more satisfying pleasure than is found by their
companions in the exciting or delusive narrations
of fiction and fancy. Illustrations of this possibility
are to be seen on every side. There are boys
and girls of ten and twelve years of age whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
chief delight in reading is in the realm of instructive
fact, and who count it beneath them to take
time for the reading of fictitious story-books—religious
or sensational. And if more parents
were wise and faithful in this department of child-training,
there would be more children with this
elevated taste in their reading.</p>

<p>It is, however, by no means an easy matter, even
though it be a simple one, for a parent to cultivate
wisely the taste of his children in their reading.
He must, to begin with, recognize the importance
and magnitude of his work so far, and must give
himself to it from the earlier years of his children
until they are well established in the good habits
he has aided them to form. He must know what
books his children ought to read, and what books
ought to be kept away from them. Then he must
set himself to make the good books attractive to
his children, while he resolutely shuts out from
their range of reading those books which are pernicious.
All this takes time, and thought, and
patience, and determination, and intelligent en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>deavor
on his part; but it is work that is remunerative
beyond its extremest cost.</p>

<p>The exclusion of that which is evil is peculiarly
important in this realm of effort; for if a child has
once gained a love of the exciting incidents of the
book of sensational fiction, it is doubly difficult to
win him to a love of narrations of sober and instructive
fact. Hence every parent should see to it
that his child is permitted no indulgence in the
reading of high-colored and over-wrought works
of fiction presented in the guise of truth—with or
without a moral; whether they come in books from
a neighbor’s house, or as a Christmas or birthday
gift from a relative, or are brought from the Sunday-school
library. Fairy tales are well enough in their
time and way, if they are read as fairy tales, and
are worth the reading—are the best of their kind.
Fiction has its place in a child’s reading, within due
bounds of measure and quality. But neither fancy
nor fiction is to be tolerated in a child’s reading in
such a form as to excite the mind, or to vitiate the
taste of the child. And for the limitation of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
reading by a child the child’s parent must hold
himself always responsible. No pains should be
spared to guard the child from mental as well as
from physical poison.</p>

<p>Keeping bad books away from a child is, however,
only one part of the work to be done in the
effort at cultivating a child’s taste in reading. A
child must be led to have an intelligent interest in
books that are likely to be helpful to him; and this
task calls for skill and tact, as well as patience and
persistency on the parent’s part. Good books must
be looked up by the parent, and when they are put
into the child’s hand it must be with such words of
commendation and explanation as to awaken in the
child’s mind a desire to become possessed of their
contents. The sex and age and characteristics and
tendencies of the child, as well as the circumstances
and associations of the hour, must all be borne in
mind in the choice and presentation of the book or
books for a child’s reading; and a due regard to
these incidents will have its effect on the mind of
the child under training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>For example, when the Fourth of July is at
hand, or is in some way brought into notice, then
is a good time to tell a child briefly about the war
of the American Revolution, and to give him a
book about the Boys of Seventy-six. When his
attention is called to a picture of the Tower of
London, he is in a good mood to read some of the
more impressive stories of English history. If he
is at the seashore, or among the mountains, on a
visit, he can be shown some object of nature,—a
shell or a crab, a rock or a tree,—as a means of
interesting him in a little book about this or that
phase of natural history or of woodcraft.</p>

<p>A child’s question about Jerusalem, or Athens,
or Rome, may be improved to his advantage by
pointing him to the narrative of the Children’s
Crusade, or to some of the collections of classic
stories in guise for children. An incidental reference
to Africa, or India, or the South Sea Islands,
may open the way for a talk with a child about
missions in those parts of the world, and may be
used to give him an interest in some of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
attractive books in description of missionary heroes
ancient and modern. The every-day mentions of
men and things may, each and all of them, in
their order, be turned to good account, as a help
in cultivating a taste in reading, by a parent who
is alert to make use of such opportunities.</p>

<p>A parent ought to be constantly on the watch to
suggest books that are suitable for his child’s reading,
and to incite his child to an interest in those
books. It is a good plan to talk with a child in
advance about the subject treated in a book, which
the parent is disposed to commend, and to tell
the child that which will tend to awaken his wish
to know more about it, as preparatory to handing
the book to him. Reading with the child, and
questioning the child concerning his reading, will
intensify the child’s interest in his reading, and
will promote his enjoyment as he reads.</p>

<p>And so it is that a child’s taste in reading will
be cultivated steadily and effectively in the right
direction by any parent who is willing to do the
work that is needful, and who is able to do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
wisely. A child needs help in this sphere, and
he welcomes help when it is brought to him. If
the help be given him, he will find pleasure as well
as profit in its using; but if he goes on without
help, he is liable to go astray, and to be a lifetime
sufferer in consequence.</p>

<i>THE VALUE OF TABLE-TALK.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In proportion as man rises in the intellectual
scale, does he give prominence to mental and moral
enjoyments in conjunction with his daily meals. He
who looks upon the table merely as a place for
feeding the body, is so far upon the level of the
lower order of animals. He who would improve
his time there for the advantage of his mind and
character, as well as for the supply of his physical
wants, recognizes a standard of utility in the humbler
offices of daily life that is perceptible only to
one whose higher nature is always striving for
supremacy above the lower.</p>

<p>With all the tendency to excesses in the line of
appetite among the Greeks and Romans in classic
times, there were even then gleams of a higher
enjoyment at the table through social intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
than that which mere eating and drinking supplied.
When the Perfect Man was here among men, he
showed the possibility of making the household
meal a means of mental and spiritual improving;
and there are no profounder or more precious
truths in the record of our Lord’s earthly teachings,
than those which are found in his words
spoken to those who sat with him eating and
drinking at their common meal. The “table talk”
of great men has, for centuries, been recognized as
having a freeness, a simplicity, and a forcefulness,
not to be found in their words spoken elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are obvious reasons why the social talk
at daily meals should possess a value not attainable
under other circumstances, in the ordinary
Christian household. Just there is the place where
all the members of the family must be together.
However closely and however diversely they may
be occupied at other times, when the hour for the
household meal has arrived, everything else must
be dropped by them all for the one duty of eating
and drinking; and they must all come together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
for that common purpose. In the very nature of
things, too, those who have gathered at the family
table must, for the time being, have left all their work
behind them, and be in a state of relaxation and of
kindlier feeling accordingly. Now it is, therefore,
that they are freest to speak with one another of
matters having a common interest to all, rather than
to dwell in absorbed thought on the special duties
from which they have, severally, turned away, or
toward which they must turn at the meal’s close.</p>

<p>It is a matter of fact that those who sit together
at a family table, whether as members of the household
or as guests there for a season, learn to understand
one another, and to give and receive help and
inspiration in their social converse, as they could
not without the advantage of this distinctive opportunity.
It is also a fact that only now and then
is there a family circle the members of which recognize
at the fullest, and make available at the
best, the value of table-talk as a training agency
for all who have a share in it, or who are under its
immediate influence. Yet he who would train his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
children as they should be trained, cannot ignore
this important training agency without serious and
permanent loss to them.</p>

<p>With family customs as they are in the United
States, there is more of an opportunity here than
abroad, for the training of children by means of
table-talk. In England, and in Europe generally,
young children are likely to be by themselves with
nurses or governesses, at meal-time, rather than at
the table with their parents. But in this country
children are, as a rule, brought to the family table
at a very early age, and are permitted to be there
not merely while the members of the family are
there gathered, but on occasions when a guest is,
for the time being, made a member of the household
circle. Therefore it is that an important feature
of child-training in American families is the
table-talk in those families. This feature varies
much in different homes; but at its best it is one
of the most potent factors in the intellectual and
moral training of the young.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago a gentleman of New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
had, as a philanthropist, an educator, and an
author, an exceptional acquaintance with men of
prominence in similar fields of endeavor in this
country and abroad. His home was a place of
resort for them. He had a large family of children,
all of whom were permitted to be at the
family table while those guests were present, as
well as at other times. The table-talk in that home,
between the parents and the guests, or between
the parents and their children when no guests were
present, was in itself “a liberal education.” It
gave to those children a general knowledge such
as they could hardly have obtained otherwise.
It was a source of promptings and of inspiration
to them in a multitude of directions. Now that
they are themselves parents and grandparents, they
perceive how greatly they were the gainers by
their training through the table-talk of their early
home; and they are doing what they can to have
the value of table-talk as a training agency for the
young recognized and made effective in the homes
which they direct or influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>In another New England home, the father was
a man of quiet thoughtfulness, and at ordinary
times a man of peculiar reticence before his children.
But at the family table he was accustomed
to unbend as nowhere else. He, also, had a large
family of children, and there were frequent visitors
among them. The utmost freedom of question
and of expression was cultivated in the table-talk
of that home. The spirited discussions carried on
there, between father and mother and children and
visitors, were instructive, suggestive, and stimulating,
in a very high degree. The family table was,
in fact, the intellectual and moral center of that
home. No other place was so attractive as that.
Not a person, young or old, would leave that
table until he had to; and now that the survivors
of that happy circle are scattered widely, every
one of them will say that no training agency did
more for him in his early life than the table-talk of
his childhood’s home.</p>

<p>In one home, where parents and children enjoy
themselves in familiar and profitable table-talk, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
is a custom to settle on the spot every question
that may be incidentally raised as to the pronunciation
or meaning of a word, the date of a
personage in ancient or modern history, the location
of a geographical site, or anything else of that
nature that comes into discussion at the family
table. As an aid to knowledge in these lines,
there stands in a corner of the dining-room a
book-rest, on the top of which lies an English
dictionary, while on the shelves below are a biographical
dictionary and a pronouncing gazetteer
of the world, ready for instant reference in every
case of dispute or doubt.</p>

<p>At the breakfast-table, in that home, the father
runs his eye over the morning paper, and gives to
his family the main points of its news which he
deems worthy of special note in the family circle.
The children there are free to tell of what they
have studied in school, or to ask about points that
have been raised by their teachers or companions.
And in such ways the children are trained to an
intelligent interest in a variety and range of sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>jects
that would otherwise be quite beyond their
ordinary observation.</p>

<p>One father has been accustomed to treasure up
the best things of his experience or studies for
each day, with a view to bringing them attractively
to the attention of his children at the family table,
at the day’s close, or at the next day’s beginning.
Another has had the habit of selecting a special
topic for conversation at the dinner-table a day in
advance, in order that the children may prepare
themselves, by thinking or reading, for a share in
the conversation. Thus an item in the morning
paper may suggest an inquiry about Bismarck, or
Gladstone, or Parnell, or Henry M. Stanley; and
the father will say, “Now let us have that man before
us for our talk to-morrow at dinner. Find
out all you can about him, and we will help one
another to a fuller knowledge of him.” In this
way the children are being trained to an ever-broadening
interest in men and things in the
world’s affairs, and to methods of thought and
study in their search for knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no end to the modes of conducting
table-talk as a means of child-training; and there
is no end to the influence of table-talk in this
direction, however conducted. Indeed, it may be
said with truth, that table-talk is quite as likely to
be influential as a means of child-training when
the parents have no thought of using it to this
end, as when they seek to use it accordingly. At
every family table there is sure to be talking; and
the talk that is heard at the family table is sure to
have its part in a child’s training, whether the
parents wish it to be so or not.</p>

<p>There are fathers whose table-talk is chiefly in
complaint of the family cooking, or in criticism of
the mother’s method of managing the household.
There are mothers who are more given to asking
where on earth their children learned to talk and
act as they do, than to inquiring in what part of
the earth the most important archæological discoveries
are just now in progress. And there are
still more fathers and mothers whose table-talk is
wholly between themselves, except as they turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
aside, occasionally, to say sharply to their little
ones, “Why don’t you keep still, children, while
your father and mother are talking?” All this
table-talk has its influence on the children. It
leads them to have less respect for their parents,
and less interest in the home table except as a
place of satisfying their natural hunger. It is
potent, even though it be not profitable.</p>

<p>Table-talk ought to be such, in every family, as
to make the hour of home meal-time one of the
most attractive as well as one of the most beneficial
hours of the day to all the children. But in
order to make table-talk valuable, parents must
have something to talk about at the table, must
be willing to talk about it there, and must have
the children lovingly in mind as they do their
table-talking.</p>

<i>GUIDING A CHILD IN
COMPANIONSHIPS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A child cannot easily go on through childhood
without companions, even if it were desirable for
him to do so. Moreover, it is not desirable for a
child to go on through childhood without companions,
even if it were every way practicable for him
to do so. Companions are a necessity to a child,
whether the case be looked at in the light of the
world as it is, or in the light of the world as it
ought to be. Hence, as a child will have companions,
and as he needs to have them, it is doubly important
that a parent be alive to the importance of
guiding his every child in the choice of his companions
and in his relations to those companions
whom he has without choosing.</p>

<p>No child can be rightly trained all by himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
nor yet wholly by means of those agencies and
influences that come to him directly from above
his head. There are forces which operate for a
child’s training through being brought to bear
upon him laterally rather than perpendicularly;
coming in upon him by way of his sympathies, instead
of by way of his natural desire for knowledge.
There are lessons which a child cannot
learn so well from an elder teacher above him as
from a young teacher alongside of him. There
are impulses which can never be at their fullest
with a child when he is alone as a child, but which
will fill and sway him when they are operative
upon him as one of a little company of children.
Only as he learns these lessons from, and receives
these impulses with, wisely chosen and fitting companions,
can a child have the benefit of them to
which he is fairly entitled.</p>

<p>Any observing parent will testify that, on more
than one occasion, his child has come to him with
a new interest in a thought or a theme, inspired by
the words or example of a young companion, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the surprise of the parent—who had before sought
in vain to excite an interest in that very direction.
All that the parent had said on the subject had
been of no value, in comparison with that which
had been said or done by the child’s companion,
as another self. Again, there are few parents who
have not found to their regret that their child has
received lessons and impulses directly opposed to
all the parental counsel and purposes, through a
brief and comparatively unnoticed companionship
that ought to have been guarded against. And
these are but illustrations of the instructive and
swaying power of child companionships. Such a
power as this ought not to be ignored or slighted
by any parent who would do most and best for
his child’s wise training.</p>

<p>Any thoughtful parent will realize that a child
cannot be trained to be unselfishly considerate of
his companions; to bear and forbear with companions
who are weak or impatient or exacting; to
show sympathy with companions who need sympathy,
and to minister lovingly to companions who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
deserve a loving ministry,—unless he has companions
toward whom he can thus exercise and evidence
a right spirit at all times. And no parent
will say, or think, that it would be well for a child
to be without these elements of character-training
in his life-progress.</p>

<p>An only child is naturally at a disadvantage in
his home, because he is an only child. He lacks
the lessons which playmates there would give him;
the impulses and inspirations which he would receive
from their fellowship; the demands on his
better nature, and the calls on his self-control and
self-denial, which would come from their requirements.
Parents who have but one child ought to
see to it that the lack in this regard is, in a measure,
supplied by the companionships of children from
other homes. It is, indeed, a mistake for any
parent to attempt the training of his child without
the help of child companionships. No child
can be so inspiringly and symmetrically trained
without, as with, these. Even where there are
half a dozen or more children in one family, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
is still a need of outside companions for each
child, of the same age and wants of that child;
for it is not possible for any person to bring
himself into the same relations with a child as
can be entered into by a child of his own years
and requirements.</p>

<p>Because a child’s companionships are so influential,
it is the more important that they be closely
watched and carefully guided by the child’s parents.
In choosing a neighborhood—for a residence or
for a summer vacation; in choosing a week-day
school; in choosing a Sunday-school, where a
choice is open to the parents, the companionships
thus secured to their child ought to have prominence
in the minds of the parents. And when the
neighborhood, and week-day school, and Sunday-school,
are finally fixed upon, the responsibility is
still upon the parent to see to it that the best available
companionships there are cultivated, and the
most undesirable ones are shunned, by the child.
Neglect or carelessness at this point may be a
means of harm to the child for his lifetime. Atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>tion
just here may do more for him than were possible
through any other agency.</p>

<p>It is a parent’s duty to know who are his child’s
companions, and to know the character, and course
of conduct, and influence upon his child, of every
one of those companions separately. Here is
where a parent’s chief work is called for in the
matter of guiding and controlling his child’s companionships.
A parent must have his child’s sympathy,
in order to gain this knowledge; and a
parent must give his sympathy to his child, in
order to be able to use this knowledge wisely.
It may be necessary to keep an open house
for these companions, and an open heart and
hand to them personally, as it surely is necessary
to keep an open ear to the child’s confidences
concerning their sayings and doings, if the
parent would know all about them that he needs to
know. There are parents who do all this for and
with their children, as an effective means of guiding
those children in their companionships. It is a
pity that there are net more who are willing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
it, in view of all that it may be a means of accomplishing
for children.</p>

<p>Knowing his child’s companionships, a parent
ought to encourage such of them as are worthiest,
and discourage such as he cannot approve. He
ought to help his child to see the advantages of the
one class and the disadvantages of the other, and
to regulate his social intimacies according to the
standards thus set before him. It will not do for a
parent to allow matters in this line to take their
own course, and to accept all companionships for
his child just as they may come to him. He must
feel responsible for his child’s wise selection, from
among the number of proffered companions, of
those who are to be retained while others are
dropped or avoided. And it devolves upon a
parent to see to it that his child’s companionships
are of growing value to his companions as well as
to himself; that his child’s influence over his very
playfellows is for their good, while his good is promoted
by their association with him. A child’s
companionships, like those of older persons, ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to be of advantage to both parties alike, through
the very purpose of making them so.</p>

<p>Recognizing the desirableness and importance
of companionships for his child, securing the best
that are available, learning fully their characteristics
and tendencies, aiding in their sifting, and seeking
in their steady uplifting, a parent can do effective
service in the way of guiding his child in and
through that child’s companionships. To neglect
this agency of a child’s training, would be to endanger
his entire career in life, whatever else were
done in his behalf.</p>

<i>NEVER PUNISH A CHILD IN ANGER.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Anger is not always wrong. A parent may be
angry without sin. And, as a matter of fact, most
parents do get angry, whether they ought to or
not. Children are sometimes very provoking, and
parents are sometimes very much provoked. It is
not always wrong to punish a child. A child may
need punishing, and it may be a parent’s duty to
punish a child accordingly. But it is always wrong
for a parent to punish a child in anger; and however
great may be the need of a child’s punishing,
a parent ought never to administer punishment to
a child while angry.</p>

<p>Here is a rule which, strictly speaking, knows
no exception; yet, as a matter of fact, probably
nine-tenths of all the punishing of children that is
done by parents in this world is done in anger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
And this is one of the wrongs suffered by children
through the wrong-doing of their parents.</p>

<p>Anger is hot blood. Anger is passion. Anger
is for the time being a controlling emotion, fixing
the mind’s eye on the one point against which it is
specifically directed, to the forgetfulness of all else.
But punishment is a judicial act, calling for a clear
mind, and a cool head, and a fair considering of
every side of the case in hand. Anger is inconsistent
with the exercise of the judicial faculty;
therefore no person is competent to judge fairly
while angry.</p>

<p>If, indeed, in any given case, the anger itself be
just, the impulse of the angry man may be in the
right direction, and the punishment he would inflict
a fitting one; but, again, his impulse may be
toward a punishment that is not merited. At all
events, the man is not in a frame of mind to decide
whether or not his impulse is a wise one; and it is
his duty to wait until he can dispassionately view
the case in another light than that in which it presents
itself to his heated brain. No judge is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
worthy of the office he administers, if he acts on
the impulse of his first estimate of a case before
him, without taking time to see what can be shown
on the other side of that case. And no parent acts
worthily who jumps to the punishment of a child
while under the impulse of an angry mood.</p>

<p>There are strong provocatives to anger in many
a child’s conduct, especially to a parent who is of
an intense nature, with an inclination to quickness
of temper. A child is disobedient at a point where
he has been repeatedly told of his duty; he is
quarrelsome with his playmates, or insolent toward
his nurse; he is persistently irritable, or he gives
way to a fit of ungovernable rage; he destroys
property recklessly, or he endangers life and limb;
he snatches away a plaything from a little brother,
or he clutches his hands into his mother’s hair; he
indulges in foul language, or he utters threats of
revenge; he meets a proffered kiss with a slap or
a scratch; his conduct may be even that which
would excite anger in a saint, but it certainly is
such as to excite anger in the average parent—who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
is not a saint. Then, while the parent is angry,
and while punishment seems merited by the child,
the temptation of the parent is to administer punishment;
but that temptation is one that ought never
to be yielded to, or, if yielded to, it is not without
sin.</p>

<p>Punishment may be needed in such a case, but
the punishment, to be surely just and to be recognized
as just, must be well considered, and
must be administered in a manner to show that
it is not the outcome of passionate impulse. No
punishment ought to be administered by a parent
at any time that would not be administered by that
parent when he was cool and calm and deliberate,
and after he had had a full and free talk on the subject
with the child, in the child’s best state of mind.
Whether the punishment that seems to the parent
to be the desert of the child, while the parent is
still angry, is the punishment that the parent would
deem the fitting one in his cooler, calmer moments,
can be better decided after the parent has looked
at it in both frames of mind, than before he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
had the advantage of a view from the standpoint
of fuller deliberation.</p>

<p>“What?” inquired a surprised parent, in conversing
with the present writer on this very subject,
“do you say that I must never punish my
boy while I’m angry with him? Why then I
should hardly ever punish him at all. It is while
I am sitting up for him hour after hour, when I’ve
told him over and over again that he must come in
early, evenings, that I feel like taking hold of him
smartly when he does come in. If I should say
nothing to him then, but should leave the matter
until the next morning, I should sleep off all my
feeling on the subject, and he wouldn’t be punished
at all.” And that father, in that statement of the
case, spoke for many a parent, in the whole matter
of the punishing of a child while angry. The punishment
which the child gets is the result of the
passion of the parent, not of the parent’s sense of
justice; and the child knows this to be the case,
whether the parent does or not.</p>

<p>How many boxes of the ear, and shakings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
shoulders, and slappings and strikings, and sentences
of doom, which the children now get from
their parents, would never be given if only the
parents refrained from giving these while angry,
but waited until they themselves were calm and
unruffled, before deciding whether to give them or
not! It is not by any means easy for a parent
always to control himself in his anger, so as to
refrain from acting on the impulse which his anger
imparts; but he who has not control of himself is
the last person in the world to attempt the control
of others. And not until a parent has himself in
perfect control ought he to take his child in hand
for the judicial investigation and treatment of his
case as an evil-doer.</p>

<p>Of course, there are cases where instant action
on the part of parents in checking or controlling
their children’s conduct is a necessity, whether
the parent be excited or calm; but in such cases
the action, however vigorous or severe, is not in the
line of punishment, but of conservation. A child
may be thoughtlessly tugging away at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
a table-cloth, with the liability of pulling over upon
his head all the table crockery, including the scalding
tea-pot; or he may be endangering himself by
reaching out toward a lighted lamp, or an open
razor. No time is to be lost. If the child does
not respond to a word, he must be dealt with
promptly and decisively. A sharp rap on the
fingers may be the surest available means of saving
him from a disaster.</p>

<p>So, again, a wayward child may be aiming a
missile at a costly mirror, or at a playmate’s head,
in a fit of temper. Not a moment can then be
wasted. Angry or not angry, the parent may have
to clutch at the child’s lifted arm to save property
or life. In such a case, wise action is called for,
regardless of the frame of mind of him who acts.
But this is the action of the peacekeeper rather
than of the minister of justice. The parent fills
for the moment the place of the policeman on
his beat, rather than of the judge on his bench.
The question of punishment for the child’s action
is yet to be considered; and that, again, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
delayed until there is no anger in the parent’s
mind.</p>

<p>Anger, in the sense of hot indignation, may, indeed,
as has already been said, be, upon an occasion,
a fitting exhibit of parental feeling; but this
is only in those utterly exceptional cases in which
a child transcends all ordinary limits of misdoing,
and is guilty of that which he himself knows to be
intolerable. As Dr. Bushnell says at this point,
“There are cases, now and then, in the outrageous
and shocking misconduct of some boy, where an
explosion is wanted; where the father represents
God best by some terrible outburst of indignant
violated feeling, and becomes an instant avenger,
without any counsel or preparation whatever.” But
this is apart from all questions of punishment as
punishment.</p>

<p>A child knows when punishment is administered
to him in anger, and when it is administered
to him in a purely judicial frame of mind; and a
child puts his estimate accordingly on him who
administers the punishment. In a city mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>- school,
many years ago, there was a wild set of
boys who seemed to do all in their power to anger
and annoy their teachers. Cases of discipline were
a necessity there; for again and again a boy attempted
violence to a teacher, and force was
required to save the teachers from serious harm.
But love swayed those teachers even when force
on their part was a necessity; and the boys seemed
to understand this fully.</p>

<p>There came a time, however, when the young
superintendent of that school, who had often held
a scholar in check by force, was made public sport
of in such way, with the rude linking of a lady
teacher’s name with his in ridicule, that his self-control
failed him for the moment, and he evidently
showed this as he took hold of the offender
with unwonted warmth. Instantly the boy started
back in surprise, with the reproachful exclamation:
“Trumbull, you’re mad; and that’s wicked.”
Those words taught a lesson to that young superintendent
which he has never forgotten. They
showed him that his power over those rough boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
was a moral power, and that it pivoted on his
retaining power over himself. It was theirs to
get him angry if they could; but if they succeeded
he was a failure, and they knew it. And that lesson
is one that parents as well as superintendents
could learn to advantage.</p>

<p>When a parent punishes a child only in love, and
without being ruffled by anger, the child is readier
to perceive the justice of the punishment, and is
under no temptation to resent passion with passion.
A child who had been told by her father, that if
she did a certain thing he must punish her for it,
came to him, on his return home, and informed
him that she had transgressed in the thing forbidden.
He expressed sincere regret for this.
“But you said, papa, that you would punish me
for it,” she added. “Yes, my dear child, and I
must keep my word,” was his answer. Then, as
he drew her lovingly to him, he told her just why
he must punish her. Looking up into his face
with tearful trust, she said: “You don’t like to
punish me,—do you, papa?” “Indeed I don’t, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
darling,” he said, in earnestness. “It hurts you
more than it hurts me,—doesn’t it, papa?” was her
sympathetic question, as if she were more troubled
for her father than for herself. “Yes, indeed it does,
my darling child,” was his loving rejoinder. And
the punishment which that father gave and that
daughter received under circumstances like these,
was a cause of no chafing between the two even
for the moment, while it brought its gain to both,
as no act of punishment in anger, however just in
itself, could ever bring, in such a case.</p>

<p>As a rule, a child ought not to be punished
except for an offense that, at the time of its committal,
was known by the child to be an offense
deserving of punishment. It is no more fair for a
parent to impose a penalty to an offense after the
offense is committed, than it is for a civil government
to pass an <i>ex post facto</i> law, by which punishment
is to be awarded for offenses committed before
that law was passed. And if a child understands,
when he does a wrong, that he must expect a fixed
punishment as its penalty, there is little danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his feeling that his parent is unjust in administering
that punishment; and, certainly, there is no
need of the parent hastening to administer that
punishment while still angry.</p>

<p>Punishment received by a child from an angry
parent is an injury to both parent and child. The
parent is the worse for yielding to the temptation
to give way to anger against a child. The child
is harmed by knowing that his parent has done
wrong. A child can be taught to know that he
deserves punishment. A child needs no teaching
to know that his parent is wrong in punishing him
while angry. No parent ought to punish a child
except with a view to the child’s good. And in
order to do good to a child through his punishing,
a parent must religiously refrain from punishing
him while angry.</p>

<i>SCOLDING IS NEVER IN ORDER.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Many a father who will not strike his child feels
free to scold him. And a scolding mother is not
always deemed the severest and most unjust of
mothers. Yet, while it is sometimes right to strike
a child, it is at no time right to scold one. Scolding
is, in fact, never in order, in dealing with a child,
or in any other duty in life.</p>

<p>To “scold” is to assail or revile with boisterous
speech. The word itself seems to have a primary
meaning akin to that of barking or howling. From
its earliest use the term “scolding” has borne a
bad reputation. In common law, “a common
scold” is a public nuisance, against which the
civil authority may be invoked by the disturbed
neighborhood. This is a fact at the present time,
as it was a fact in the days of old. And it is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to-day as it was when spoken by John Skelton,
four centuries ago, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“A sclaunderous tunge, a tunge of a skolde,</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;Worketh more mischiefe than can be tolde.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Scolding is always an expression of a bad spirit
and of a loss of temper. This is as truly the
case when a lovely mother scolds her child for
breaking his playthings wilfully, or for soiling his
third dress in one forenoon by playing in the gutter
which he was forbidden to approach, as when
one apple-woman yells out her abuse of another
apple-woman in a street-corner quarrel. In either
case the essence of the scolding is in the multiplication
of hot words in expression of strong feelings
that, while eminently natural, ought to be held
in better control. The words themselves may
be very different in the two cases, but the spirit
and method are much alike in both. It is scolding
in the one case as in the other; and scolding
is never in order.</p>

<p>If a child has done wrong, a child needs talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to; but no parent ought to talk to a child while
that parent is unable to talk in a natural tone of
voice, and with carefully measured words. If the
parent is tempted to speak rapidly, or to multiply
words without stopping to weigh them, or to show
an excited state of feeling, the parent’s first duty is
to gain entire self-control. Until that control is
secured, there is no use of the parent’s trying to
attempt any measure of child-training. The loss
of self-control is for the time being an utter loss of
power for the control of others. This is as true in
one sphere as in another.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond’s admirable work on “Dog-Training,”
already referred to in these pages, says
on this very point, to the dog-trainer: “You must
keep perfectly cool, and must suffer no sign to
escape of any anger or impatience; for if you cannot
control your temper, you are not the one to
train a dog.” “Do not allow yourself,” says this
instructor, “under any circumstances to speak to
your pupil in anything but your ordinary tone of
voice.” And, recognizing the difficulties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
case, he adds: “Exercise an unwearied patience;
and if at any time you find the strain upon your
nerves growing a little tense, leave him at once,
and wait until you are perfectly calm before resuming
the lesson.” That is good counsel for him who
would train a dog—or a child; for in either dog-training
or child-training, scolding—loud and excited
talking—is never in order.</p>

<p>In giving commands, or in giving censure, to a
child, the fewer and the more calmly spoken
words the better. A child soon learns that scolding
means less than quiet talking; and he even
comes to find a certain satisfaction in waiting
silently until the scolder has blown off the surplus
feeling which vents itself in this way. There are
times, indeed, when words may be multiplied to
advantage in explaining to a child the nature and
consequences of his offense, and the reasons why
he should do differently in the future; but such
words should always be spoken in gentleness, and
in self-controlled earnestness. Scolding—rapidly
spoken censure and protest, in the exhibit of strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
feeling—is never in order as a means of training
and directing a child.</p>

<p>Most parents, even the gentler and kindlier
parents, scold their children more or less. Rarely
can a child say, “My parents never scold me.”
Many a child is well trained in spite of his being
scolded. Many a parent is a good parent notwithstanding
the fact that he scolds his children. But
no child is ever helped or benefited by any scolding
that he receives; and no parent ever helps or
benefits his child by means of a scolding. Scolding
is not always ruinous, but it is always out
of place.</p>

<p>If, indeed, scolding has any good effect at all,
that effect is on the scolder, and not on the scolded.
Scolding is the outburst of strong feeling that
struggles for the mastery under the pressure of
some outside provocation. It never benefits the
one against whom it is directed, nor yet those who
are its outside observers, however it may give
physical relief to the one who indulges in it. If,
therefore, scolding is an unavoidable necessity on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the part of any parent, let that parent at once shut
himself, or herself, up, all alone, in a room where
the scolding can be indulged in without harming
any one. But let it be remembered that, as an
element in child-training, scolding is never, never,
in order.</p>

<i>DEALING TENDERLY WITH A
CHILD’S FEARS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The best child in the world is liable to be full of
fears; and the child who is full of fears deserves
careful handling, in order that his fears may not
gain permanent control of him. Fears are of a
child’s very nature, and every child’s training must
be in view of the fact that he has fears. How to
deal wisely, firmly, and tenderly with a child’s fears
is, therefore, one of the important practical questions
in the training of a child.</p>

<p>To begin with, it should be understood that a
child’s fears are no sign of a child’s weakness, but
that, as a rule, the stronger a child is in the elements
of a well-balanced and an admirable character,
the more fears he will have to contend with
in the exercise of his character. Hence a child’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fears are worthy of respect, and call for tenderness
of treatment, instead of being looked at as a cause
of ridicule or of severity on the part of those who
observe them.</p>

<p>“Fear” is not “cowardice.” Fear is a keen perception
of dangers, real or imaginary. Cowardice
is a refusal to brave the dangers which the fears
recognize. Fear is the evidence of manly sensitiveness.
Cowardice is the exhibit of unmanly
weakness. Fear is a moral attribute of humanity.
Cowardice is a moral lack. A child, or a man, who
is wholly free from cowardice, may have more fears
than the veriest coward living. The one struggles
successfully against his many fears; the other
yields in craven submission to the first fear that
besets him.</p>

<p>It is by no means to a child’s credit that it can
be said of him, “He doesn’t know what fear is.”
A child ought to know what fear is. He is pitiably
ignorant if he does not. The same is true of the
bravest man. It is not the soldier who does not
know fear but it is the soldier who will not yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to the fears he feels, who is the truly courageous
man. Without a fine perception and a quick apprehension
of dangers on every side, no soldier
could be fully alive to the necessities of his position
and to the demands of his duty; and it is, in
a sense, peculiarly true, that the best soldier is likely
to be the most fearful. It is the Braddocks who
are “not afraid” that needlessly suffer disaster;
while the Washingtons who have timely fears are
prepared to act efficiently in the time of disaster.
There is a suggestion of this truth in the words of
the Apostle, “Let him that thinketh he standeth
take heed lest he fall;” or, as it might be said, Let
him who has no fears have a care lest he fail from
his lack of fears.</p>

<p>A child’s fears are on various planes, and because
of this they must be differently dealt with. A child
has fears which are reasonable, fears which are unreasoning,
and fears which are wholly imaginary;
fears which are the result of a process of reasoning,
fears which are apart from any reasoning process,
and fears which are in the realm of fancy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
imagination. In one child one phase of these fears
is the more prominent, and in another child another
phase. But in every child there is a measure of
fear on all three of these planes.</p>

<p>A child who has once fallen in trying to stand
or walk, or from coming too near the top of a
flight of stairs, is liable to be afraid that he will
fall again if he makes another effort in the same
direction. “A burnt child dreads the fire.” That
is a reasonable fear. Again, a child comes very
early to an instinctive shrinking from trusting himself
to a stranger; he recoils from an ill-appearing
person or thing; he trembles at a loud noise; he
is fearful because of the slamming of shutters, even
when he knows that the wind does it; he is afraid
of thunder as well as of lightning, apart from any
question of harm to him from the electric bolt.
This is without any process of reasoning on his
part, even while there is a basis of reality in the
causes of his fear. Yet again, a child is afraid of
being alone in the darkness; or he is afraid of
“ghosts” and “goblins,” about which he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
told by others. It is his imagination that is at
work in this case.</p>

<p>That all these different fears should call for precisely
the same treatment is, of course, an absurdity.
How to deal with each class of fears by itself, is an
important element in the question before the parent
who would treat wisely the fears of his children.</p>

<p>A child would be obviously lacking in sense, if
he were never afraid of the consequences of any
action to which he was inclined. If he had no fear
of falling, no fear of fire or water, no fear of edged
tools or machinery, no fear of a moving vehicle,
it would be an indication of his defectiveness
in reasoning faculties. Yet that there is a wide
difference among children in the measure of their
timidity in the presence of personal danger, no one
will deny.</p>

<p>One child inclines to be unduly cautious, while
another inclines to be unduly venturesome. Moreover,
that the timidest child can be brought to
overcome, in large measure, his fears of physical
harm, is apparent in view of the success of primi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>tive
peoples in training their children to swim before
they can walk, or to climb as soon as they
can stand; and of circus managers in bringing the
children of civilized parents to feats of daring
agility. How to train a child to the mastery of
his fears in this line, without the brutal disregard
of his feelings that too often accompanies such
training by savages or professional athletes, is a
point worthy of the attention of every wise parent.</p>

<p>Because these fears are within the realm of the
reasoning faculties, they ought to be removed by
means of a process of reasoning. A child ought
not to be beaten or threatened or ridiculed into
the overcoming of his fears, but rather encouraged
and directed to their overcoming, through
showing him that they ought to, and that they
can, be overcome. His fears are not unworthy of
him; therefore he ought neither to be punished
nor to be made sport of because he has them.
The meeting and surmounting of his fears, within
bounds, is also worthy of a child; therefore he
ought to be helped to see this fact, and kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
cheered and sympathized with in his efforts accordingly.</p>

<p>Many a child has been trained to intelligent
fearlessness, so far as he ought to be fearless,
through the wise and tender endeavors of his
parents to show him his power in this direction,
and to stimulate him to the exercise of this power.
And many a child has been turned aside from the
overcoming of his fears, through the untimely
ridicule of him for his possession of those fears.
Because he must be a laughing-stock while struggling
to master his fears, he decides to evade the
struggle in order to evade the ridicule. Tenderness
in pointing out to a child the wiser way of
meeting his fears, is better than severity on the
one hand, or ridicule on the other.</p>

<p>Unreasoning or instinctive fears are common to
both the brightest and the dullest children. They
are among the guards which are granted to humanity,
in its very nature, for its own protection.
It would never do for a child to make no distinction
between persons whom he could trust implicitly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and persons whom he must suspect, or shrink
from. It is right that he should be won or repelled
by differences in form and expression. He needs
to be capable of starting at a sudden sound, and of
standing in awe of the great forces of nature. The
proper meeting of these instinctive fears by a child
must be through his understanding of their reasonable
limits, and through the intelligent conforming
of his action to that understanding. It is for the
parent to train his child to know how far he must
overcome these fears, and how far they must still
have play in his mind. And this is a process requiring
tenderness, patience, and wisdom.</p>

<p>When a child shows fear at the moaning of the
wind about the house, and at its rattling of the
shutters on a winter’s night, it is not fair to say to
him, “Oh, nonsense! What are you afraid of?
That’s nothing but the wind.” There is no help
to the child in that saying; but there is harm to
him in its suggestion of the parent’s lack of sympathy
with him. If, however, the parent says, at
such a time, “Does that sound trouble you? Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
me tell you how it comes;” and then goes on to
show how the wind is doing God’s work in driving
away causes of sickness, and how it sometimes
makes sweet music on wires that are stretched out
for it to play upon,—the child may come to have
a new thought about the wind, and to listen for
its changing sounds on the shutters or through
the trees.</p>

<p>One good mother sought to overcome her little
boy’s fear of thunder by simply telling him that it
was God’s voice speaking out of the heavens; but
that was one step too many for his thoughts to take
as yet. The thunder just as it was, was what gave
him trouble, no matter where it came from; so
when the next peal sounded through the air, the
little fellow whimpered out despairingly, “Mamma,
baby doesn’t like God’s voice.” And that mother
was too wise and tender to rebuke her child for his
unreadiness for that mode of revelation from above.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an equally wise and tender
father, whose little daughter was afraid of the
thunder, took his child into his arms, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
thunder-storm was raging, and carried her out on
to the piazza, in order, as he said, to show her
something very beautiful. Then he told her that
the clouds were making loud music, and that the
light always flashed from the clouds before the
music sounded, and he wanted her to watch for
both light and music. His evident enthusiasm on
the subject, and his manifest tenderness toward his
child, swept the little one away from her fears, out
toward the wonders of nature above her; and soon
she was ready to believe that the thunder was as
the very voice of God, which she could listen to
with reverent gratitude. If there were more of
such loving wisdom exercised in parental dealing
with children’s fears, there would be less trouble
from the unmastered fears of children on every side.</p>

<p>The hardest fears to control are, however, the
fears which are purely of the imagination; and no
other fears call for such considerate tenderness
of treatment as these, in the realm of child-training.
It is the more sensitive children, children
of the finest grain, and of the more active and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
potent imaginings, who are most liable to the
sway of these fears, and who are sure to suffer
most from them. Persons who are lacking in the
imaginative faculty, or who are cold-blooded and
matter-of-fact in their temperament and nature,
are hardly able to comprehend the power of these
fears over those who feel them at their fullest.
Hence it is that these fears in a child’s mind are
less likely than any others to receive due consideration
from parents generally, even while they
need it most.</p>

<p>Because these fears are not of the reason, they
are not to be removed by reason. Because they
are of the imagination, the imagination must be
called into service for their mastery. It is not
enough to pronounce these fears unreasonable and
foolish. They are, in their realm, a reality, and
they must be met accordingly. While children
suffer from them most keenly, they are not always
outgrown in manhood. A clergyman already past
the middle of life was heard to say that, to this
day, he could never come up the cellar stairs all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
by himself, late at night, after covering up the furnace
fire for the night, without the irrational fear
that some one would clutch him by his feet from
out of the darkness below. The fear was a reality,
even though the cause was in the imagination.
And a soldier who had been under fire in a score
of battles, said that he would to-day rather go into
another battle than to be all alone in a deserted
house in broad daylight.</p>

<p>In neither of these cases was the person under
the influence of superstitious fears, but only of
those fears which an active imagination will suggest
in connection with possibilities of danger beyond
all that can yet be seen. And these are but
illustrations of the sway of such fears in the minds
of men who are stronger by reason of their very
susceptibility to such fears. These men have added
power because of their vivid imaginations; and
because of their vivid imaginations they are liable
to fears of this sort. What folly, then, to blame a
child of high imagination for feeling the sway of
similar fears!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The heroic treatment of these fears of the imagination
is not what is called for in every instance;
nor is it always sufficient to meet the case. A
child may be trained to go by himself into the
darkness, or to sleep in a room shut away from
other occupants of the house, without overcoming
his fears of imagination. And if these fears be
constantly spoken of as those which are utterly
unworthy of him, the child may indeed refrain
from giving expression to them, and suffer all by
himself with an uncalled-for sense of humiliation,
even while he is just as timid as before. It would
be better, in many a case, to refrain from an undue
strain on a sensitive child, through sending him
out of the house in the evening to walk a lonely
path, or through forcing him to sleep beyond the
easy call of other members of the household; but
in every instance it is right and wise for a parent
to give his child the evidence of sympathy with
him in his fears, and of tender considerateness of
him in his struggles for their overcoming.</p>

<p>The help of helps to a child in meeting his fears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of the imagination, is found in the bringing to his
mind, through the imagination, a sense of the constant
presence of a Divine Protector to cheer him
when his fears are at their highest. A little child
who wakened in the middle of the night, called to
her parents, in another room, and when her father
was by her bedside, she told him that she was
afraid to be alone. Instead of rebuking her for
this, he said, “There’s a little verse in the Bible,
my darling, that’s meant for you at a time like this;
and I want you to have that in your mind whenever
you waken in this way. It is a verse out of
one of David’s psalms; and it is what he said to
the Lord his Shepherd: ‘What time I am afraid, I
will trust in thee.’ That is the verse. Now, whenever
you are afraid, you can think of that verse,
and say it over as a loving prayer, and the Good
Shepherd will hear you, and will keep you from
all harm.”</p>

<p>The child repeated the verse after her father, and
she saw its peculiar fitness to her case. As her
father then prayed to the God of David in loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
confidence, she realized more fully than before how
near God was to her in the time of her greatest
fears. And from that time on, that little child was
comforted through faith when her imagination
pressed her with its terrors. She never forgot that
verse; and it still is a help to her in her fears by
day and by night.</p>

<p>A child’s imagination ought, indeed, to be
guarded sacredly. It should be shielded as far
as possible from unnecessary fears, through foolish
stories of ghosts and witches, told by nurses or
companions, or read from improper books. But
whether a child’s fears in this realm be few or
many, they should be dealt with tenderly by a
loving parent; not ignored, nor rudely overborne.
Many a child has been harmed for life through a
thoughtless disregard by his parents of the fears of
his imagination. But every child might be helped
for life by a sympathetic and tender treatment of
these fears, on the part of his parents, while he is
still under their training.</p>

<p>In no realm of a child’s nature has a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
greater need of sympathy and tenderness from
his parents, than in the realm of his fears. It is
because he is sensitive, and in proportion as he is
sensitive, that a child’s fears have any hold upon
him. And a child’s sensitiveness is too sacred to
be treated rudely or with lightness by those to
whom he is dearest, and who would fain train him
wisely and well.</p>

<i>THE SORROWS OF CHILDREN.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The trials and sorrows of children and young
people have not always had the recognition they
deserve from parents and teachers. It is even customary
to speak of childhood as an age of utter
freedom from anxiety and grief, and to look upon
boys and girls generally as happier and lighter-hearted
than they can hope to be in later life. No
mistake could be greater than this. The darker
side of life is seen first. The brighter side comes
afterward.</p>

<p>“Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.”
The first sound of a child’s voice is a cry,
and that cry is many times repeated before the
child gives his first smile. How easily the best-behaved
baby cries, every mother can testify. It is
the soothing of a crying child, not the sharing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the joy of a laughing one, which taxes the skill
and the patience of a faithful nurse. Only as the
child is trained, disciplined, to overcome his inclination
to cry, and to find happiness in his sphere,
does he come to be a joyous and glad-hearted
little one.</p>

<p>Every burden of life—and life’s burdens seem
many—rests at its heaviest on a child’s nature.
A child is refused more requests than are granted
to him. He is subjected to disappointments daily,
almost hourly. The baby cannot reach the moon,
nor handle papa’s razor, nor pound the looking-glass,
nor pull over the tea-pot, nor creep into the
fire. The older child cannot eat everything he
wants to, nor go out at all times, nor have papa
and mamma ever at his side. Then there come
school-tasks to shrink from, and the jealousies and
unkindnesses of playmates and companions to
grieve over. And as more is known of life and
the world, and the inevitable struggles with temptation,
and of the injustice and wrongs which must in
so many instances be suffered, it becomes harder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
harder for a young person to see only the brighter
side of human existence, and to bear up bravely
and cheerily under all that tends to sadden and
oppress us. There are more clouds in the sky of
life’s April than of life’s August.</p>

<p>As the young grow older they come to be less
sensitive to little trials, and they control themselves
better. They are not tempted to shed tears whenever
they find their plans thwarted, or themselves
unable to do or to have all they would like to, or
their companions unlike what they had hoped for.
They learn to philosophize over their troubles, to
look at the compensations of life, and to recognize
the fact that many things which they have longed
after would not have been good for them if they
had obtained them, and that, at all events, time will
soften many of their trials. And so life’s troubles
seem lighter, and life’s joys greater—if not more
intense—to maturer minds than to the young.
Even when men are far greater sufferers than ever
children can be, they come to be calloused in a
measure through the very continuance of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
grief, and they bear as a little thing that which
would have crushed them a few years before.</p>

<p>But how their former experiences and their
earlier tumults of feeling are forgotten by men
and women as they get farther and farther away
from childhood! They fail to remember how
deeply they grieved as little ones. They forget,
in large measure, how heavy the burdens of life
seemed in their earlier years. They are sure that
many things which now trouble them had no
power over them when they were younger. It
seems to them, indeed, that the little trials of children
cannot seem very large even to children.
And so, as they watch the little ones in their
brighter moments, they think that childhood is the
age of freedom from sorrow and care; and they
are even inclined to wish that they were young
once more, that they might have no such hours of
trial and grief as now they are called to so
frequently.</p>

<p>Values are relative; so are losses; so are sorrows.
One person puts a high estimate on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
another deems quite worthless. One grieves over a
loss for which another would feel no concern.
That which a child values highly may be of no
moment to the child’s father; but its loss might be
as great a grief to the child as would the loss to
the father of that which, in the father’s sight, is
incalculably more important. The breaking of a
valued toy may be as serious a disaster, from the
child’s point of view, as the bankrupting of the
father’s business would seem from the father’s
standpoint. And the child’s temporary censure by
his playmates for some slight misdoing of his, may
cause to him as bitter a sorrow as would the condemnation
by the public, cause to his father when
the father’s course had brought him into permanent
disgrace.</p>

<p>A little girl was startled by what she heard said
at the family table concerning a neighbor’s loss
of household silver through a visit of robbers.
“Mamma,” she whispered, “do robbers take
<i>dolls</i>?” Her dolls were that child’s treasure. If
<i>they</i> were in danger, life had new terrors for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
“No, my dear,” said her mamma; “robbers don’t
want dolls. Why should they take them?” “I
didn’t know but they would want them for their
little girls,” was the answer; as showing that, in
the child’s estimation, dolls had a value for children
in the homes of robbers as well as elsewhere.
With the assurance that her dolls were safe, that
little girl had less fear of midnight robberies.
What, to her mind, was the loss of the family silver,
or of clothing and jewels, if the dolls were to
be left unharmed! A child’s estimate of values
may be a false one; but the child’s sorrows over
losses measured by those estimates are as real as
any one’s sorrows.</p>

<p>It must, indeed, be a sore pressure of sorrow and
trial on a child’s mind and heart, to bring him to
commit suicide; yet the suicide of a child is by no
means so rare an act as many would suppose. The
annual official statistics of suicides in France show
a considerable percentage of children among the
unhappy victims. Hundreds of suicides are reported
in England, year by year. In America the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
case is much the same. Month by month the
public prints give the details of child suicides as a
result of some sore trial or sorrow to the little ones.</p>

<p>“Forgive me for committing suicide,” wrote a
bright and affectionate lad, in a note to his father
just before committing the fatal act. “I am tired
of life,” he added. And everything in connection
with his suicide showed that that lad had planned
the act with a cool head and an aching heart.
In fact, most persons of adult years can recall
out of the memories of their earlier life some experiences
of disappointment, or of grief, or of a
sense of injustice, which made life seem to them
for the time being no longer worth living, and the
thought of an end to their trial in death not wholly
terrible. Very <i>childish</i> all this was, of course; but
that is the point of its lesson to parents; childish
griefs are very real and very trying—to children.</p>

<p>One plain teaching of these facts concerning the
sorrows of children is, that the young need the
comfort and joys of a Christian faith for the life
that now is, quite as surely as the aged need a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Christian hope for the life that is to come. The
surest way of bringing even a child to see the
brighter side of this life is by inducing him to
put his trust in an omnipotent Saviour, who loves
him, and who makes all things work together for
good to him if only he trust himself to His care
and walks faithfully in His service. The invitations
and the promises of the Bible are just what
children need, to give them happiness and hope
for now and for hereafter.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>XXV.<br /><br />

<i>THE PLACE OF SYMPATHY IN
CHILD-TRAINING.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>A child needs sympathy hardly less than he
needs love; yet ten children are loved by their
parents where one child has his parents’ sympathy.
Every parent will admit that love for his children
is a duty; but only now and then is there a parent
who realizes that he ought to have sympathy with
his children. In fact, it may safely be said that,
among those children who are not called to suffer
from actual unkindness on the part of their parents,
there is no greater cause of unhappiness than the
lack of parental sympathy. And, on the other
hand, it is unquestionably true that in no way can
any parent gain such power over his child for the
shaping of the child’s character and habits of life as
by having and showing sympathy with that child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Love may be all on one side. It may be given
without being returned or appreciated. It may
fail of influencing or affecting the one toward
whom it goes out. But sympathy is in its very
nature a twofold force. It cannot be all on one
side. From its start it is a response to another’s
feelings or needs. It is based on the affections, or
inclinations, or sufferings, or sense of lack, already
experienced by another. Hence sympathy is sure
of a grateful recognition by the one who has called
it out. Love may be proffered before it is asked
for or desired. Sympathy is in itself the answer to
a call for that which it represents. Love may, indeed,
be unwelcome. Sympathy is, in advance,
assured of a welcome.</p>

<p>In his joys as in his sorrows a true child wants
some one to share his feelings rather than to guide
them. If he has fallen and hurt himself, a child
is more helped by being spoken to in evident sympathy
than by being told that he must not cry, or
that his hurt is a very trifling matter. The love
that shows itself in tenderly binding up his wound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
in a case like this, has less hold upon the child
than the sympathy that expresses a full sense of
his pain, and that recognizes and commends his
struggle to control his feelings under his injury.
It is easier, indeed, to comfort a child at such a
time, and to give him power over himself, by showing
him that you feel with him, and how you want
him to feel, than by telling him, never so lovingly,
what he ought to do, and how to do it. And it is
the same with a child in any time of joy, as in
every time of grief. He wants your sympathy
with him in his delights, rather than your loving
approval of his enjoying himself just then and
in that way.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, who makes as little of the finer
sentiments of human nature as any intelligent observer
of children can safely do, emphasizes this
desire of a child for sympathy, in the realm of
mental development. “What can be more manifest,”
he asks, “than the desire of children for
intellectual sympathy? Mark how the infant sitting
on your knee thrusts into your face the toy it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
holds, that you too may look at it. See, when it
makes a creak with its wet finger on the table,
how it turns and looks at you; does it again, and
again looks at you; thus saying as clearly as it
can—‘Hear this new sound.’ Watch how the
older children come into the room exclaiming,
‘Mamma, see what a curious thing,’ ‘Mamma, look
at this,’ ‘Mamma, look at that;’ and would continue
the habit, did not the silly mamma tell them
not to tease her. Observe how, when out with
the nurse-maid, each little one runs up to her with
the new flower it has gathered, to show her how
pretty it is, and to get her also to say it is pretty.
Listen to the eager volubility with which every
urchin describes any novelty he has been to see,
if only he can find some one who will attend
with any interest.”</p>

<p>How many parents there are, however, who are
readier to provide playthings for their children
than to share the delights of their children with
those playthings; readier to set their children at
knowledge-seeking, than to have a part in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
children’s surprises and enjoyments of knowledge-attaining;
readier to make good, as far as they can,
all losses to their children, than to grieve with their
children over those losses. And what a loss of
power to those parents as parents, is this lack of
sympathy with their children as children. There
are, however, parents who sympathize with their
children in all things; and as a result, they practically
train and sway their children as they will:
for when there is entire sympathy between two
persons, the stronger one is necessarily the controlling
force with both.</p>

<p>In order to sympathize with another, you must
be able to put yourself in his place, mentally and
emotionally; to occupy, for the time being, his
point of view, and to see that which he sees, and
as he sees it, as he looks out thence. It is not
that your way of looking at it is his way from
the start, but it is that his way of looking at it
must be your way while you are taking your start
in an effort to show your sympathy with him. In
many relations of life, sympathy would be impossi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>ble
between two parties, because of the differences
of taste and temperament and habits of thought;
but in the case of parent and child, the parent
ought to be able to learn the child’s ways of
thinking and modes of feeling, so as to come
into the possibility of sympathy with the child
at all times.</p>

<p>How the child ought to feel is one thing. How
the child does feel is quite another thing. The
parent may know the former better than the child
does; but the latter the child knows better than
the parent. Until a parent has learned just how
the child looks at any matter, the parent is incapable
of so coming alongside of the child in his estimate
of that matter as to win his confidence and
to work with him toward a more correct view of
it. To stand off apart from the child, and tell him
how he ought to think and feel, may be a means
of disheartening him, as he finds himself so far
from the correct standard. But to stand with the
child and point him to the course he ought to
pursue, is more likely to inspire him to honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
efforts in that direction, until he comes to think
and to feel as his parents would have him.</p>

<p>A parent misses an opportunity of gaining added
power over his child, when he fails to show sympathy
with that child in the child’s enjoyments and
ordinary occupations. If, indeed, the parent would
be always ready to evidence an interest in his
child’s plays and companionships and studies, the
parent would grow into the very life of his child in
all these spheres; and there would be hardly less
delight to the child in talking those things over
with his parent afterward, than in going through
with them originally. But if the parent seems to
have no share with the child in any one or all of
these lines of childhood experience, the child is
necessarily shut away so far from his parent, and
compelled to live his life there as if he were
parentless.</p>

<p>Still more does a parent lose of opportunity for
good to his child, if he fails to have sympathy with
his child in that child’s weaknesses and follies and
misdoings. It is in every child’s nature to long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
for sympathy at the point where he needs it most;
and when he has done wrong, or has indulged evil
thoughts, or is feeling the force of temptation, he
is glad to turn to some one stronger and better
than himself, and make confession of his faults and
failures. If, as he comes to his parents at such a
time, he is met with manifest sympathy, he is
drawn to his parents with new confidence and new
trust. But if he is met unsympathetically, and is
simply told how wrong he is, or how strange it
seems that he should be so far astray, he is turned
back upon himself to meet his bitterest life-struggle
all by himself; and a new barrier is reared
between him and his parents, that no parental love
can remove, and that no parental watchfulness or
care can make a blessing to either child or parent.</p>

<p>It is a great thing for a parent to have such
sympathy with his child that his child can tell him
freely of his worst thoughts or his greatest failures
without any fear of seeming to shock that
parent, and so to chill the child’s confidence. It is
a great thing for a parent to have such sympa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>thetic
thoughts of his child when that child has
unintentionally broken some fragile keepsake peculiarly
dear to the parent, as to be more moved by
regret for the child’s sorrow over the mishap than
for the loss of the precious relic. There is no such
power over children as comes from such sympathy
with children.</p>

<p>There is truth in the suggestion of Herbert
Spencer, that too often “mothers and fathers are
mostly considered by their offspring as friend-enemies;”
and that it is much better for parents to
<i>show</i> to their children that they are “their best
friends,” than to content themselves with <i>saying so</i>.
It ought to be so, that children would feel that
they could find no such appreciative sympathy
from any other person, in their enjoyments or in
their sorrows and trials, as they are sure of from
their parents. This is so in some cases; and
wherever it is so, the parents have such power
over and with their children as would otherwise be
impossible. On the other hand, there are parents
who love their children without stint, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
would die to promote their welfare, who actually
have no sympathy with their children, and who,
because of this lack of sympathy, are without
the freest confidences of their children, and are
unable to sway them as they fain would.</p>

<p>The power of sympathy is not wholly a natural
one. It is largely dependent upon cultivation. An
unsympathetic parent may persistently train himself
to a habit of sympathy with an unsympathetic
child, by recognizing his duty of learning
how the child thinks and feels, and by perceiving
the gain of getting alongside of that child
in loving tenderness in order to bring him to a
better way of thinking and feeling. But if a
parent and child are not in sympathy, the best
and most unselfish love that that parent can give
to that child will be fruitless for such results in
child-training as would be possible if that love
were directed by sympathy.</p>

<i>INFLUENCE OF THE HOME
ATMOSPHERE.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In the world of nature, life is dependent on the
atmosphere. Whatever else is secured, the atmosphere
is essential to life’s existence. It is, in fact,
the atmosphere that gives the possibility of all the
varied forms of vegetable and animal life in the
earth and the sea and the air. So, again, the atmosphere
brings death to every living thing, if
elements that are hostile to life prevail in its composition.
When the question of the date of man’s
first appearance on our planet is under discussion,
a chief factor in the unsolved problem is the nature
of the atmosphere of the earth at any given period
of antiquity. Without a life-sustaining atmosphere,
life were an impossibility. Similarly, the question
of the probability of other planets being inhabited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
pivots on this consideration. Life and death are
in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is not alone the component elements of the
atmosphere that bring life or death to all within its
scope; but the temperature and the measure of
movement of the atmosphere go far to decide the
degree of life that shall be attained or preserved
within the scope of its influence. Unless there is
a due measure of oxygen in the air, the atmosphere
is death-giving. Without sufficient warmth to the
air, its oxygen is of no avail for the sustaining of
life. And even though the oxygen and the warmth
be present, the force of the swift-moving air may
carry death on its vigorous wings. No gardener
would depreciate the importance of a right atmosphere
for his most highly prized plants; nor would
any wise physician undervalue the sanitary importance
of the atmospheric surroundings of his patients.
As it is in the natural world, so it is in the
moral sphere: life and death are in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>A vital question in connection with every home
is, Is the atmosphere of this home suited to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
life and growth, to the developing of the vigor and
beauty, of a child’s best nature? That question
cannot always be answered in the affirmative; and
where it cannot be, it is of little use to talk of the
minor training agencies which are operative in behalf
of the children in that home.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of a home is the spirit of that
home, as evidenced in the conduct and bearing of
the parents, and of all whom the parents influence.
The atmosphere itself—there, as in all the natural
world—is not seen, but is felt. Its effects are
clearly observable; but as a cause it is inferred
rather than disclosed. Indeed, the better the atmosphere
in a home, the more quietly pervasive its
influence. Only as the home atmosphere is inimical
to the best interests of those who feel its
power, does that atmosphere make itself manifest
as an atmosphere, rather than give proof of its
existence in results that cannot otherwise be accounted
for.</p>

<p>You enter one home, and, mingling with the
family there, you feel the balmy air of love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
sympathy. Parents and children seem to live for
one another, and to be in complete accord in all
their enjoyments and occupations; and all is restful
in the peace that abides there. You are sure
that everything in the moral and social atmosphere
of that home tends to the fostering and growth of
whatever is best in the child-nature. It is obvious
that it is easier for a child to be good, and to do
well, in such a home as that, than in many another
home.</p>

<p>You enter another home, and the chill of the
household air strikes you unpleasantly, at the first
greeting given to you by any member of the family.
There is a side of the child-nature that you know
needs more warmth than that for its developing.
Again it is the burning heat of an excited and
ever-driving household life that you are confident
is withering the more delicate and sensitive tendrils
of the young hearts being trained there. Yet
again, it is the explosive storm-bursts of passion
which tear through the air, that make a home a
place of peril to the young for the time being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
however it may seem in the lulls between tempests.
In the one case as in the others, it is the
home atmosphere that settles the question of the
final tendency of the home training.</p>

<p>In view of the importance of the home atmosphere,
parents ought to recognize their responsibility
for the atmosphere of the home they make
and control. It is not enough for parents to have
a lofty ideal for their children, and to instruct and
train those children in the direction of that ideal.
They must see to it that the atmosphere of their
home is such as to foster and develop in their children
those traits of character which their loftiest
ideal embodies. That atmosphere must be full of
the pure oxygen of love to God and love to man.
It must be neither too hot in its intensity of social
activities, nor too cold in its expressions of family
affection, but balmy and refreshing in its uniform
temperature of household living and being. It
must be gentle and peaceful in its manner and
movement of sympathetic intercourse. All this it
may be. All this it ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Every home has its atmosphere, good or bad,
health-promoting or disease-breeding. And parents
are, in every case, directly responsible for the nature
of the atmosphere in their home; whether
they have acted in recognition of this fact, or have
gone on without a thought of it. In order to secure
a right home atmosphere for their children, parents
must themselves be right. They must guard
against poisoning the air of the home with unloving
words or thoughts; against chilling it with
unsympathetic manners, or overheating it with exciting
ways; against disturbing its peaceful flow
with restlessness, with fault-findings, or with bursts
of temper.</p>

<p>Parents must, as it were, keep their eyes on the
barometer and the thermometer of the social life
of the home, and see to it that its temperature is
safely moderated, and that it is guarded against the
effect of sudden storms. Only as such care is
taken by wise parents, can the atmosphere in their
home be what the needs of their children require
it to be.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>XXVII.<br /><br />

<i>THE POWER OF A MOTHER’S LOVE.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In estimating the agencies which combine for
child-shaping through child-training, the power of
a mother’s love cannot be overestimated. There
is no human love like a mother’s love. There is
no human tenderness like a mother’s tenderness.
And there is no such time for a mother’s impressive
display of her love and tenderness toward her
child as in the child’s earliest years of his life.
That time neglected, and no future can make good
the loss to either mother or child. That time improved,
and all the years that follow it shall give
added proof of its improvement.</p>

<p>Even when a man seems to be dead to every
other influence for good, the recollection of a
mother’s prayers and a mother’s tears often has a
hold upon him which he neither can nor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
break away from. And a mother is so much to a
man when he is a man, just because she was all in
all to him when he was a child.</p>

<p>Although God calls himself our Father, he compares
his love with the love of a mother, when he
would disclose to us the depth of its tenderness,
and its matchless fidelity. “As one whom his
mother comforteth, so will I comfort you,” he says,
as if in invitation to the sinner to come like a
grieved and tired child, and lay down his weary
head on his mother’s shoulder, where he is sure of
rest and sympathy, and of words of comfort and
cheer. “Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should not have compassion on the son of
her womb?” asks God, as if to turn attention to
that which is truest and firmest of anything we can
know of human affection and fidelity. And then
to show that he is a yet surer support than even
mothers prove to their loved children, he adds,
“Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget
thee.”</p>

<p>David, the man after God’s own heart, could find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
no words which could express his abiding confidence
in God, like those wherein he declares,
“When my father and my mother forsake me,
then the Lord will take me up.” Nor could he
find any figure of the profoundest depth of human
sorrow more forcible than that in which he says
of himself, “I bowed down heavily, as one that
mourneth for his mother.” When David’s greater
Son was hanging on the cross in agony, with the
weight of a lost world upon him, he could forget
all his personal suffering, and could turn, as it
were, for a moment, from the work of eternal redemption,
to recognize the tenderness and fidelity
of his agonized mother at his feet, and to commend
her with his dying breath to the faithful ministry
of the disciple whom he loved.</p>

<p>The Bible abounds with pictures of loving
mothers and of a mother’s love,—Hagar, weeping
in the desert over her famishing boy; Rachel
mourning for her children, refusing to be comforted
because they were not; Jochebed playing the
servant to secure the privilege of nursing her babe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
for the daughter of Pharaoh; Hannah joying before
God over her treasure of a longed-for son;
the true mother in the presence of Solomon, ready
to lose her child that it might be saved; Rizpah,
watching on the hill-top the hanging bodies of her
murdered sons, month after month, from the beginning
of harvest until the autumn rains, suffering
“neither the birds of the air to rest on them by
day, nor the beasts of the field by night;” the wife
of Jeroboam, longing to be at the bedside of her
dying son, and torn at heart with the thought that
as soon as she should reach him there he must
die; the widow of Zarephath, and the Shunammite
woman, securing the intercession of the prophet
for the restoration to life of their dead darlings;
the mother of James and John pleading with Jesus
for favors to her sons; the Syro-Phœnician woman
venturing everything, and refusing to be put aside,
that she might win a blessing from Him who alone
was able to restore to health and freedom her
grievously vexed daughter; the mother of Timothy,
teaching her son lessons by which the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
is still profiting; and so on through a long list of
those who were representative mothers, chosen of
God for a place in the sacred record, and whose
like are about us still on every side.</p>

<p>And the Bible injunctions concerning mothers
are as positive as the examples of their loving
ministry are numerous. “Honor thy father and
thy mother” is a commandment which has pre-eminence
in the reward attached to it. “Forsake
not the law of thy mother,” said Solomon; “and
despise not thy mother when she is old.” It is
indeed a “foolish man,” as well as an unnatural
one, who “despiseth his mother,” or who fails to
give her gratitude and love so long as she is spared
to him. In all ages and everywhere, the true children
of a true mother “rise up and call her
blessed;” for they realize, sooner or later, that God
gives no richer blessing to man than is found in a
mother’s love. Even in the days when a queen-wife
was a slave, a queen-mother was looked up to
with reverence, not because she had been a queen,
but because she was still the king’s mother. “A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
mother dead!” wrote gruff and tender-hearted Carlyle.
“It is an epoch for us all; and to each one
of us it comes with a pungency as if peculiar, a
look as of originality and singularity.” And it
was of the mother whose death called out this
ejaculation, of whom, while she was still living,
Carlyle had written, “I thought, if I had all the
mothers I ever saw to choose from, I would have
chosen my own.”</p>

<p>A mother can never be replaced. She will be
missed and mourned when she has passed away,
however she may be undervalued by the “foolish
son” to whom she still gives the wealth of her
unappreciated affection. Indeed, the true man
never, while his mother is alive, outgrows a certain
sense of dependence on a loving mother’s sympathy
and care. His hair may be whitened with
age; he may have children, and even grandchildren,
looking up to him in respect and affection;
but while his mother lives she is his mother,
and he is her boy. And when she dies he for
the first time realizes the desolateness of a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>less
son. There is then no one on earth to whom
he can look up with the never-doubting confidence
and the never-lacking restfulness of a tired child
to a loving mother. There is a shelter taken away
from above his head, and he seems to stand unprotected,
as never before, from the smiting sun and
the driving storms of life’s pilgrimage. He can
no more be called “My dear son” in those tones
which no music of earth can equal. To him
always:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“A mother is a mother still,</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;The holiest thing alive.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Biography is rich with illustrations of this truth,
although the man whose mother is still spared
to him need not go beyond his own experience
to recognize its force. Here, for example, is testy
old Dr. Johnson, bearish and boorish in many
things. When he is fifty years old, and his mother
is ninety, he writes to her in tenderness: “You
have been the best mother, and, I believe, the best
woman, in the world. I thank you for your indulgence
to me, and beg forgiveness of all that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
done ill, and of all that I have omitted to do well.”
How many men there are whom the world little
thinks of as child-like, who could make these words
their own, and set their hands to them with Johnson’s
closing assurance, “I am, dear, dear mother,
your dutiful son.” And the lion-hearted Luther,
who seems better suited to thunder defiance at
spiritual oppressors than to speak words of trustful
affection to a kind-hearted woman, turns from his
religious warfare to write to his aged and dying
mother: “I am deeply sorrowful that I cannot be
with you in the flesh, as I fain would be.” “All
your children pray for you.”</p>

<p>St. Augustine has been called the most important
convert to the truth from St. Paul to Luther. Near
the close of his eventful life, St. Augustine said:
“It is to my mother that I owe everything. If I
am thy child, O my God! it is because thou gavest
me such a mother. If I prefer the truth to all
things, it is the fruit of my mother’s teachings. If
I did not long ago perish in sin and misery, it is
because of the long and faithful years which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
pleaded for me.” And of his mother’s remembered
devotedness to him, he said at the time of
her death: “O my God! what comparison is there
between the honor that I paid to her, and her
slavery for me?”</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams’s mother lived to be seventy-four;
but he had not outgrown his sense of personal
dependence upon her, when she was taken
away. “My mother was an angel upon earth,” he
wrote. “She was the real personification of female
virtue, of piety, of charity, of ever-active and never-intermitting
benevolence. O God! could she have
been spared yet a little longer!” “I have enjoyed
but for short seasons, and at long, distant intervals,
the happiness of her society, yet she has been to
me more than a mother. She has been a spirit
from above watching over me for good, and contributing,
by my mere consciousness of her existence,
to the comfort of my life. That consciousness
has gone, and without her the world feels to
me like a solitude.” When President Nott, of
Union College, was more than ninety years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and had been for half a century a college president,
as strength and sense failed him in his dying hours,
the memory of his mother’s love was fresh and
potent, and he could be hushed to needed sleep by
patting him gently on the shoulder, and singing to
him the familiar lullabies of long ago, after the
fashion of that mother, who he fancied was still at
hand to care for him.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay has been called a cold-hearted
man, but he was never unmindful of the unique
preciousness of a mother’s love. He it was who
said: “In after life you may have friends, fond,
dear, kind friends, but never will you have again
the inexpressible love and gentleness lavished
upon you which a mother bestows. Often do I
sigh, in my struggles with the hard, uncaring
world, for the sweet deep security I felt when, of
an evening, nestling in her bosom, I listened to
some quiet tale, suitable to my age, read in her
untiring voice. Never can I forget her sweet
glances cast upon me when I appeared asleep;
never, her kiss of peace at night. Years have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
passed since we laid her beside my father in the
old churchyard, yet still her voice whispers from
the grave and her eye watches over me as I visit
spots long since hallowed to the memory of my
mother.”</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, with all his self-reliance
and personal independence of character, never
ceased to look up to his mother with a reverent
affection, and he was accustomed to say that he
owed all that he was, and all that he had, to her
character and loving ministry. “Ah, what a woman!
where shall we look for her equal?” he said of her.
“She watched over us with a solicitude unexampled.
Every low sentiment, every ungenerous
affection, was discouraged and discarded. She
suffered nothing but that which was grand and
elevated to take root in our youthful understandings....
Losses, privations, fatigue, had no effect
on her. She endured all, braved all. She had the
energy of a man combined with the gentleness and
delicacy of a woman.”</p>

<p>When all else seemed lost to him, as he lay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
lonely prisoner on the shores of St. Helena, Napoleon
was sure of one thing. “My mother loves
me,” he said; and the thought of his mother’s
love was a comfort to him then. He who had felt
able to rule a world unaided, was not above a
sense of grateful dependence on a love like that.
“My opinion is,” he said, “that the future good
or bad conduct of a child depends entirely upon
its mother.”</p>

<p>A young army officer lay dying, at the close of
our American civil war. He had been much away
from home even before the war; and now for four
years he had been a soldier in active army service.
On many a field of battle he had faced death fearlessly,
and in many an hour of privation and hardship
he had been dependent on his own strength
and resources. What could more have tended to
wean a man from reliance on a mother’s presence
and sustaining care? The soldier’s mind was wandering
now. It was in the early morning, after a
wakeful, restless night. Exciting scenes were evidently
before his mind’s eye. The enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
pressing him sorely. He was anxious as to his
position. He gave orders rapidly and with vehemence.
His subordinates seemed to be failing
him. Everything was apparently wrong. Just
then the young officer’s mother, who had come
from the North to watch over him, entered the
room where he lay. As the door opened for her
coming, he turned toward it his troubled face, as if
expecting a new enemy to confront him. Instantly,
as he saw who was there, his countenance changed,
the look of anxiety passed away, the eye softened,
the struggle of doubt and fear was at an end, and
with a deep-drawn sigh of relief he said in a tone
of restful confidence, “Ah, mother’s come! It’s
all right now!” And the troubled veteran soldier
was a soothed child again.</p>

<p>Soldier, statesman, scholar, divine; every man is
a child to his mother, to the last; and it is the best
that is in a man that keeps him always in this
child-likeness toward his loving mother. Were it
not for the power of a mother’s love, that best and
truest side of a man’s nature would never be de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>veloped,
for the man’s good and for the mother’s
reward. It costs something to be a good mother;
but there is no reward which earth can give to be
compared with that love which a faithful mother
wins and holds from the son of her love. Oh! if
good mothers could only know how much they are
doing for their children by their patient, long-suffering,
gentle ways with them, and how sure
these children are to see and feel this by and by,
the saddest of them would be less sad and more
hopeful, while toiling and enduring so faithfully,
with perhaps apparently so slight a return.</p>

<i>ALLOWING PLAY TO A CHILD’S
IMAGINATION.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Imagination is a larger factor in the thoughts
and feelings of a child than in the thoughts and
feelings of an adult; and this truth needs to be
recognized in all wise efforts at a child’s training.
The mind of a child is full of images which the
child knows to be unreal, but which are none the
less vivid and impressive for being unreal. It is
often right, therefore, to allow play to a child’s
imagination, when it would not be right to permit
the child to say, or to say to the child, that which
is false.</p>

<p>A child who is hardly old enough to speak perceives
the difference between fact and fancy, and is
able to see that the unreal is not always the false.
Hence a very young child can understand that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
“make believe” to him is not to attempt to deceive
him. A child in his mother’s lap, who is not yet
old enough to stand alone, is ready to pull at a
string fastened to a chair in front of his mother’s
seat, and play that he is driving a horse. As he
grows older, he will straddle a stick and call that
riding horseback; telling his parent, perhaps, of
the good long ride he is taking. Not only is it
not a parent’s duty to tell that child that the chair
or the stick is not a horse, but it would be unfair,
as well as unkind, to insist on that child’s admission
that his possession of a horse is only in
his fancy.</p>

<p>The child is here not deceived to begin with;
therefore, of course, he does not need to be undeceived.
Yet it would be wrong for the parent
to permit his child to say, as if in reality, that he
had been taken out to ride by his father, when
nothing of the kind had happened. In the latter
case the statement would be a false one, while in
the former case it would be only a stretch of fancy.
The child as well as the parent would have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
difficulty in recognizing the difference between the
two statements.</p>

<p>A little girl will delight herself with setting a
table with buttons for plates and cups, from which
she will serve bread and cake and tea to her invited
guests; and she will be lovingly grateful for her
mother’s apparently hearty suggestion that “this
tea is of a fine flavor,” when she would feel hurt if
her mother were to tell her, coolly and cruelly, that
it was only a dry button which had been passed as
a cup of tea. The fancy in this case is truer by
far than the fact. There is no deception in it; but
there is in it the power of an ideal reality. And it
is by the dolls and other playthings of childhood
that some of the truest instincts of manhood and
of womanhood are developed and cultivated in the
progress of all right child-training.</p>

<p>It is in view of this distinction that the story of
Santa Claus and Christmas Eve may be made one
of reprehensible falsity, or one of allowable fancy.
The underlying idea of Santa Claus is, that on
the birth-night of the Holy Child Jesus there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
comes a messenger from him to bring good gifts
to children. So far the idea is truth. Just how
the messenger from Jesus comes, and just who he
is, are matters in the realm of fancy. The child is
entitled to know the truth, and is entitled also to
indulge in a measure of fancy. For a parent to
take a child, the night before, and show him all
the Christmas gifts arranged in a drawer as preparatory
to the stocking-filling, leaving no room
for the sweet indulgings of fancy, would neither be
wise nor be kind. It would not accord with the
God-given needs of the child’s nature. Nor, again,
would it be wise or kind for the parent to tell the
full story of Santa Claus and his reindeers as if it
were an absolute literal fact. Children have, indeed,
been frightened by the belief that Santa
Claus would come down the chimney at night,
and would refuse them presents if they were
awake at his coming; and this is all wrong. The
child should be taught the truth as the truth,
and indulged in the fancy as fancy.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, much the same in this realm as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the Bible realm. To say that Jesus is the Good
Shepherd is to present a truth in the guise of fancy;
and unless a child is helped to know the measure
of truth and to perceive the sweep of fancy, there
is a danger of trouble in using this Bible figure;
for it is a fact that children have suffered from the
thought that they were to be literal “lambs” in the
Saviour’s fold. This recognition of the limits between
the fanciful and the false needs to be borne
in mind at every stage of a child’s training. The
false is not to be tolerated. The fanciful is to
be allowed a large place.</p>

<p>This truth applies also to the realm of fairy-tale
reading. A child can read choice fairy tales,
understanding that they are fanciful, with less danger
to his mind and character than he would incur
in the reading of a falsely colored religious story-book.
In the one case he knows that the narration
is wholly fanciful, while in the other case he is
liable to be misled through the belief that what
is both fictitious and false may have been a reality.
Not the wholly fanciful, but the fictitiously false, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
a child’s reading, is most likely to be a means of
permanent harm to him.</p>

<p>A child’s imagination can safely be allowed large
play, in his amusements, in his speech, and in his
reading. He knows the difference between the
fanciful and the false quite as well as his parents
do. It is the line between the false and the real in
moral fiction that he needs help in defining. It
will be well for him if he has parents who understand
that distinction, and who are ready to give
him help accordingly.</p>

<i>GIVING ADDED VALUE TO A
CHILD’S CHRISTMAS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Christmas is a day of days to the little folks, because
of the gifts it brings to them. But Christmas
gifts have a greater or a lesser value in the eyes of
children according to the measure of the giver’s
self which is given with them. It is not that children
intelligently prize their gifts, as older persons
are likely to, in proportion as they read in them
the proofs of the giver’s loving labor in their
preparation. But it is that to children the Christmas
gifts by themselves are of minor value, in comparison
with the interest excited in the manner
of their giving, through labors that really represent
the giver’s self, whether the children perceive
this, at the time, or not.</p>

<p>The Christmas stocking and the Christmas tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
give added value to the gifts that they cover; and
neither tree nor stocking can be made ready for
Christmas morning without patient and loving
labor, on the part of the parents, during the night
before. Moreover, beyond the dazzling attractions
of the ornamented tree, and the suggestive outline
of the bulging stocking, the more there is to provoke
curiosity and to incite endeavor, on the children’s
part, in the finding and securing of their
Christmas portion, the better the children like it,
and the more they value that which is thus made
theirs.</p>

<p>It takes time and work and skill to make the
most, for the children, of a Christmas morning;
but it pays to do this for the darlings, while they
still are children. They will never forget it; and
it will be a precious memory to them all their
life through. It is one of the child-training agencies
which a parent ought to be glad to use
for good.</p>

<p>One good man might be named who has brought
to perfection the art of making Christmas delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>ful
to children. He has no children of his own;
so he makes it his mission to give happiness to
other people’s children. The story of bright and
varied Christmas methods in his home would fill
a little volume. His plans for Christmas are never
twice alike; hence the children whom he gathers
say truly, “There was never anything like <i>this</i> before.”
Take a single Christmas for example. This
child-lover was busy getting ready for it for weeks
in advance. Money he spent freely, but he did
not stop with that. Day and evening, with a loving
sister’s help, he worked away getting everything
just to his mind—which was sure to be just
to the children’s mind. At last Christmas eve
was here; so were the children—nieces and
nephews, and others more remote of kin, gathered
in his home to wait for the hoped-for day.</p>

<p>Christmas morning came at last. Waking and
sleeping dreams had all been full of coming delights
to the children; for they knew enough from
the past to be sure that good was in store for
them. No one overslept, that morning. Accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ing
to orders, they gathered in the breakfast-room.
Their stockings were hanging from the mantel, but
limp and empty. Not one suspicious package or
box was to be seen. Breakfast was first out of the
way, that the morning might be free for a right
good time. Then the day was fairly open. Each
went to his or her stocking. There was nothing
in it but a little card, pendent from a thread coming
over the mantel edge. On that card was a
rhyming call to follow the thread wherever it
might lead; somewhat after this form:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Charley, dear, if you’ll follow your nose,</div>
<div class="line i1">And your nose will follow this string</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the house, wherever it goes,—</div>
<div class="line i1">You will come to a pretty thing.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Every stocking told the same story, in varied
form, and every child stood holding a frail thread,
wondering to what it would lead, and waiting
the signal for a start. At the word, all were
off together.</p>

<p>It was a rare old house, richly furnished with
treasures of art and fancy from all the world over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
The breakfast-room was heavily paneled in carved
wood and hung with ancient Gobelin tapestry.
The threads which the children followed passed
back of the large Swiss clock, along the wall
under the tapestry, out by the parlor with its
Cordova-leather panels, into a picture-hung reception
room, and there mounted to the ceiling above,
up through a colored glass sky-light. When the
children saw that, they scampered through the
marble-tiled hall, up the broad polished walnut
staircase to the passage above, and there drew
up their threads, and started on a new hunt.</p>

<p>From this fresh point of departure the different
threads took separate directions. They led hither
and thither, the children following, almost holding
their breaths with the excitement of pursuit and
expectation. Along the corridor walls, under rows
of Saracen tiles and Italian majolica and Sèvres
porcelain, back of old paintings, through the well-filled
library, into and out of closets stored with
fishing-tackle and hunting-gear, through rooms
spread with Turkish mats and rich with coverings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of Persian embroidery, up into the third story,
and down along the under side of the banister
rail, back to the lower floor, again the threads led
the way and the children followed. It was a happy
hour for old and young.</p>

<p>By and by the threads came once more to a common
point, passing under a closed door out of a rear
hall, where a printed placard called on each child
to wait until all were together. One by one they
came up with beaming faces and bounding hearts.
The door was opened. There in the center of the
disclosed room were seven mammoth pasteboard
Christmas boots, holding from one to three pecks
each, marked with the names of the several children,
and filled to overflowing. Each child seized
a boot, and hurried, as directed, back to the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>Then came new surprises. All hands sat on the
floor together. Only one package at a time was
opened, that all might enjoy the disclosures to the
full. And there were unlooked-for directions on
many a package. One child would take a package<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
from her Christmas boot, and, on removing the
first wrapper, would find a written announcement
that the package was to be handed over to her
cousin. A little later, the cousin would be directed
to pass along another package to a third
one of the party. And so the morning went by.
How happy those children were! What life-long
memories of enjoyment were then made for them!
And how thoroughly the good uncle and aunt
enjoyed that morning with its happiness which
they had created!</p>

<p>There were elegant and fitting presents found
in those Christmas boots; but the charm of that
day was in the mysteries of that pursuing chase
all over that beautiful house, and in the excitements
of prolonged anticipation and wonder. Those
children will never have done enjoying that morning.
The choicest gifts then received by them had
an added value because their generous giver had
put so much of himself into their preparation and
distribution. And this is but an illustration of a
truth that is applicable in the whole realm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
efforts at gladdening the hearts of the little ones
on Christmas or any other day. It matters not,
so far, whether the home be one of abundance
or of close limitations, whether the gifts be many
or few, costly of inexpensive.</p>

<p>He who would make children happy must do
for them and do with them, rather than merely
give to them. He must give himself with his
gifts, and thus imitate and illustrate, in a degree,
the love of Him who gave himself to us, who is
touched with the sense of our enjoyments as well
as our needs, and who, with all that He gives us,
holds out an expectation of some better thing in
store for us: of that which passeth knowledge and
understanding, but which shall fully satisfy our
hopes and longings when at last we have it in
possession.</p>

<i>GOOD-NIGHT WORDS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>If there is one time more than another when
children ought to hear only loving words from
their parents, and be helped to feel that theirs is
a home of love and gladness, it is when they are
going to bed at night. Good-night words to a
child ought to be the best of words, as they are
words of greatest potency. Yet not every parent
realizes this important truth, nor does every child
have the benefit of it.</p>

<p>The last waking thoughts of a child have a
peculiar power over his mind and heart, and are
influential in fixing his impressions and in shaping
his character for all time. When he turns from
play and playmates, and leaves the busy occupations
of his little world, to lie down by himself to
sleep, a child has a sense of loneliness and depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>ence
which he does not feel at another time. Then
he craves sympathy; he appreciates kindness; he
is grieved by harshness or cold neglect.</p>

<p>How glad a true child is to kneel by his mother’s
knee to pray his evening prayer, or to have his
father kneel with him as he prays! How he
enjoys words of approval or encouragement when
they precede the good night kiss from either parent!
With what warm and grateful affection his
young heart glows as he feels the tender impress
of his mother’s hand or lips upon his forehead
before he drops asleep. How bright and dear to
him that home seems at such an hour! How
sorry he is for every word or act of unkindness
which he then recalls from his conduct of the day!
How ready he then is to confess his specific acts of
misdoing, and all his remembered failures, and to
make new resolves and purposes of better doing
for the future!</p>

<p>Whatever else a child is impatient to grow away
from, he does not readily outgrow the enjoyment
of his mother’s good-night. As long as she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
willing to visit his bedside, and give him a kiss,
with a loving word, just before he goes to sleep,
he is sure to count that privilege of his home as
something above price, and without which he
would have a sense of sad lack. And at no time
is he more sure than then to be ready to do whatever
his mother would ask of him; at no time do
gentle, tender words of loving counsel from her
sink deeper into his heart, or make an impression
more abiding and influential.</p>

<p>There are young men and women, still at their
childhood’s home, who look for their mother’s
coming to give them her good-night kiss, with
no less of interest and grateful affection than when
they were little boys and girls. And there are many
more people—both young and old—away from
their homes, who thank God with all their hearts
for the ineffaceable memories of such tokens of their
dear mother’s love, while yet they were with her.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, however, there is perhaps
no one thing in which parents generally are more
liable to err than in impatient or unloving words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to their children when the little ones are going to
bed. The parents are tired, and their stock of
patience is at the lowest. If the children are not
as quiet and orderly and prompt as they should
be, the parents rebuke them more sharply than
they would for similar offenses earlier in the day.
Too often children go to bed smarting under a
sense of injustice from their parents, and brood
over their troubles as they try to quiet themselves
down to sleep. Their pillows are often wet with
their tears of sorrow, and their little hearts are,
perhaps, embittered and calloused through the
abiding impressions of the wrong they have suffered,
or the harshness they have experienced,
while they were most susceptible to parental influences
for good or ill.</p>

<p>It is a simple matter of fact that some parents
actually postpone the punishment of their children
for the misdeeds of the day until the leisure hour
of twilight and bed-time. A great many mothers
besides the “old woman who lived in a shoe,”
in providing for a large family of children, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
often “whipped them all soundly, and sent them
to bed.” Perhaps children, as a rule, receive more
whippings at bed-time than at any other of the
twenty-four hours. And unquestionably they then
have more scoldings.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me, children?” sounds out the
voice of many a mother into the nursery as the
children are getting to bed. “If you don’t stop
playing and talking, and go right to sleep, I’ll
come up there and just <i>make</i> you.” And that
is the echo of that mother’s voice which rings
longest in her children’s ears.</p>

<p>Again, there are mothers who, without any
thought of unkindness, are unwise enough to deliberately
refuse a good-night kiss to their children,
as a penalty for some slight misconduct; not
realizing the essential cruelty of withholding from
the little ones this assurance of affection, at a time
when the tender heart prizes it above all else.
The first effect of such a course as this is to cause
bitterness of grief to the children. The repetition
of such a course is liable to loosen the parent’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
loving hold on the little ones, and to diminish the
value of the good-night kiss. It is, indeed, probably
true, that more children out of reputable homes
are soured, and estranged, and are turned astray,
through harshness and injustice, or by unwise
severity, at their bed-time hour, than from any
other provoking cause in their home-life.</p>

<p>Even where there is no harshness of manner
or severity of treatment on the part of the parents,
there is often an unwise giving of prominence, just
then, to a child’s faults and failures, so as to sadden
and depress the child unduly, and to cast a shade
over that hour which ought to be the most hopeful
and restful of all the waking hours. Whatever
is said by a parent in the line of instruction
toward a better course, at such a time, should be
in the way of holding up a standard to be reached
out after, rather than of rebuking the child’s misdoings
and shortcomings in the irrevocable past.
The latest waking impressions of every day, on
every child, ought to be impressions of peace and
joy and holy hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>A sensitive, timid little boy, long years ago, was
accustomed to lie down to sleep in a low “trundle-bed,”
which was rolled under his parents’ bed by
day, and was brought out for his use by night.
As he lay there by himself in the darkness, he
could hear the voices of his parents, in their
lighted sitting-room, across the hall-way, on the
other side of the house. It seemed to him that
his parents never slept; for he left them awake
when he was put to bed at night, and he found
them awake when he left his bed in the morning.
So far this thought was a cause of cheer to him,
as his mind was busy with imaginings in the weird
darkness of his lonely room.</p>

<p>After loving good-night words and kisses had
been given him by both his patents, and he had
nestled down to rest, this little boy was accustomed,
night after night, to rouse up once more,
and to call out from his trundle-bed to his strong-armed
father, in the room from which the light
gleamed out, beyond the shadowy hall-way, “Are
you there, papa?” And the answer would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
back cheerily, “Yes, my child, I am here.” “You’ll
take care of me to-night, papa; won’t you?” was
then his question. “Yes, I’ll take care of you, my
child,” was the comforting response. “Go to sleep
now. Good-night.” And the little fellow would
fall asleep restfully, in the thought of those assuring
good-night words.</p>

<p>A little matter that was to the loving father;
but it was a great matter to the sensitive son.
It helped to shape the son’s life. It gave the
father an added hold on him; and it opened up
the way for his clearer understanding of his dependence
on the loving watchfulness of the All-Father.
And to this day when that son, himself a
father and a grandfather, lies down to sleep at
night, he is accustomed, out of the memories of
that lesson of long ago, to look up through the
shadows of his earthly sleeping-place into the
far-off light of his Father’s presence, and to call
out, in the same spirit of child-like trust and helplessness
as so long ago, “Father, you’ll take care
of me to-night; won’t you?” And he hears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
assuring answer come back, “He that keepeth
thee will not slumber. The Lord shall keep thee
from all evil. He shall keep thy soul. Sleep, my
child, in peace.” And so he realizes the twofold
blessing of a father’s good-night words.</p>

<p>A wise parent will prize and will rightly use the
hour of the children’s bed-time. That is the
golden hour for good impressions on the children’s
hearts. That is the parent’s choicest opportunity of
holy influence. There should be no severity then,
no punishment at that time. Every word spoken
in that hour should be a word of gentleness and
affection. The words which are most likely to be
borne in mind by the children, in all their later
years, as best illustrating the spirit and influence
of their parents, are the good-night words of those
parents. And it may be that those words are the
last that the parents shall ever have the privilege
of speaking to their children; for every night of
sleep is a pregnant suggestion of the night of the
last sleep. Let, then, the good-night words of
parents to their children be always those words by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
which the parents would be glad to be remembered
when their voices are forever hushed; and
which they themselves can recall gladly if their
children’s ears are never again open to good-night
words from them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
